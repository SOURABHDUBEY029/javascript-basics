1
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,261
<i>A famous man once said,</i>

2
00:00:09,428 --> 00:00:12,097
<i>"We create our own demons."</i>

3
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,642
<i>Who said that?
What does that even mean?</i>

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:17,689
<i>It doesn't matter.
I said it because he said it.</i>

5
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:19,313
<i>So, now, he was famous</i>

6
00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:21,899
<i>and it's basically getting said
by two well-known guys.</i>

7
00:00:22,232 --> 00:00:23,609
<i>I don't...</i>

8
00:00:23,817 --> 00:00:25,819
<i>I'm going to start again.</i>

9
00:00:27,321 --> 00:00:29,489
<i>Let's track this from the beginning.</i>

10
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:07,861
Half hour till the ball drops.

11
00:01:09,196 --> 00:01:10,197
- Hey, do you wanna...
- Tony Stark?

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,760
- Great speech, man!
- I got you, pal.

13
00:01:11,782 --> 00:01:13,408
I gave a speech? How was it?

14
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:15,156
- Edifying.
- Unintelligible.

15
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,912
Really? It's my favourite kind.
A winning combo.

16
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,835
- Where are we going?
- To town, on each other.

17
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:19,915
Probably back in your room

18
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,124
because I also want
to see your research.

19
00:01:21,208 --> 00:01:22,209
Okay, you can see my research,

20
00:01:22,292 --> 00:01:24,253
but that's...
I'm not gonna show you my "town."

21
00:01:24,336 --> 00:01:25,545
Mr Stark.

22
00:01:25,629 --> 00:01:26,629
Ho Yinsen.

23
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:28,674
I finally met a man called "Ho."

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,094
I would like to introduce you
to our guest, Dr Wu.

25
00:01:32,344 --> 00:01:33,637
- Oh, this guy.
- Mr Stark.

26
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:38,058
You're a heart doctor. She's going to
need a cardiologist after I...

27
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:42,771
Perhaps another time?

28
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:47,192
<i>It started in Bern, Switzerland.
1999.</i>

29
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,362
<i>- The old days.
- Mr Stark!</i>

30
00:01:50,654 --> 00:01:52,823
<i>I never thought they would
come back to bite me.</i>

31
00:01:52,906 --> 00:01:53,907
<i>Why would they?</i>

32
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,701
Wow! Hey, Tony!

33
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:59,371
Aldrich Killian.
I'm a big fan of your work.

34
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:00,981
- My work?
- Who isn't? He means me.

35
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,250
Of course, but Ms Hansen,

36
00:02:03,417 --> 00:02:06,753
my organisation's been tracking
your research since year two of MIT.

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,921
Yeah, we're full.

38
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:10,382
Wow, he made it. He made the cut.

39
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,709
What floor you going to, pal?

40
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,218
Well, now, that is
an appropriate question.

41
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,465
The ground floor, actually,

42
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:16,471
of a proposal
I'm putting together myself.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,392
It's a privately funded think tank
called Advanced Idea Mechanics.

44
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:24,396
She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.

45
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:28,150
"Advanced Idea Mechanics,"
or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?

46
00:02:28,233 --> 00:02:29,833
I see that,
because it's on your T-shirt.

47
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,405
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.

48
00:02:33,572 --> 00:02:35,198
Thank you, I'll call you.

49
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,120
I'm titillated by the notion
of working with you.

50
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:41,567
- Yeah?
- I'll ditch these clowns.

51
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,300
I'll see you up
on the roof in five minutes.

52
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:44,875
Just gonna try
and get my beak wet real quick.

53
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,043
You know what I'm talking about?

54
00:02:46,126 --> 00:02:47,127
I'll see you up there.

55
00:02:47,294 --> 00:02:48,587
Damn betcha.

56
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,340
Come on!
I thought that was just a theory.

57
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,716
Well, it was.

58
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,509
If I'm right, we can access the area
of the brain

59
00:02:54,593 --> 00:02:55,594
- that governs repair...
- Wow.

60
00:02:55,677 --> 00:02:57,012
And chemically recode it.

61
00:02:57,095 --> 00:02:59,514
That's incredible. Essentially,
you're hacking into the genetic...

62
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:00,682
operating system...

63
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,142
of a living organism. Exactly.

64
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:03,518
- Yes.
- Wow.

65
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:04,644
Is that... Can you...

66
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,229
- What?
- Can you not touch my plant?

67
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:08,023
It's not...
She doesn't like it. She prefers...

68
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,108
She's not like the others.
Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.

69
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:12,235
- Happy...
- That's cute...

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,779
Leave her ficus alone.

71
00:03:13,862 --> 00:03:14,905
Because“.
And, no, seriously, don't.

72
00:03:14,988 --> 00:03:17,115
- And you're starting with plants.
- For now, yeah.

73
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,451
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.

74
00:03:20,911 --> 00:03:22,162
- Well, it's...
- Human application.

75
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,455
Exactly, exactly.

76
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:25,625
- Dendritic revitalisation.
- It's revolutionary.

77
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,042
- Disease prevention...
- Change the world.

78
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,585
Even limb regrowth.

79
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:31,463
You're the most gifted woman
I've ever met.

80
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,798
Wow.

81
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:35,425
- In Switzerland.
- That's better.

82
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,552
- You're seeing things.
- This week.

83
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,679
You almost bought it, didn't you?

84
00:03:50,649 --> 00:03:52,329
This is what I'm talking about,
the glitch.

85
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,693
Have you checked
the telomerase algorithm?

86
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,861
- The what?
- Down!

87
00:03:55,404 --> 00:03:57,322
Stay down! Stay down, boss.

88
00:03:57,489 --> 00:03:58,949
- We're good.
- Stay down.

89
00:03:59,116 --> 00:04:01,159
You're right on me. I made it.

90
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:03,829
What the hell was that?

91
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
- What was that?
- It's a glitch in my work. It's...

92
00:04:07,124 --> 00:04:08,458
She was just talking about it.
Glitches happen.

93
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,668
It's not Y2K.

94
00:04:09,835 --> 00:04:11,503
Hey! Happy New Year!

95
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:12,990
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

96
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:14,297
All right.
I'll see you in the morning. Good night.

97
00:04:14,381 --> 00:04:15,424
- You good?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:15,507 --> 00:04:17,467
- I'll be right outside.
- Okay, cool.

99
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,905
<i>So, why am I telling you this?</i>

100
00:04:39,614 --> 00:04:42,784
<i>Because I had just created demons</i>

101
00:04:43,618 --> 00:04:45,370
<i>and I didn't even know it.</i>

102
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:49,749
<i>Yeah, those were good times.</i>

103
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,461
<i>Then I moved on.</i>

104
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,839
<i>After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave,
I said goodbye to the party scene.</i>

105
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,448
<i>I forgot that night in Switzerland.</i>

106
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:01,303
<i>- These days, I'm a changed man.
- Forty-six.</i>

107
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:03,763
<i>I'm different now.</i>

108
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:05,015
<i>I'm... Well...</i>

109
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,601
<i>- Forty-seven.
- You know who I am.</i>

110
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,604
<i>Sir, please may I request
just a few hours to calibrate...</i>

111
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,105
No. Forty-eight.

112
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,152
Micro-repeater
implanting sequence complete.

113
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:18,236
<i>As you wish, sir.</i>

114
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:21,364
<i>I've also prepared a safety briefing
for you to entirely ignore.</i>

115
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:23,074
Which I Will.

116
00:05:23,492 --> 00:05:24,659
All right, let's do this.

117
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:26,703
<i>BUM-E.</i>

118
00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:27,787
Hi, DUM-E.

119
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,207
How did you get that cap on your head?
You earned it.

120
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:32,209
Hey. Hey!

121
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,712
What are you doing out of the corner?
You know what you did.

122
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:38,089
Blood on my mat. Handle it.

123
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:42,177
<i>Sir, may I remind you that you've been
awake for nearly 72 hours?</i>

124
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,012
Focus up, ladies.

125
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,932
Good evening,
and welcome to the birthing suite.

126
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,392
<i>I am pleased to announce
the imminent arrival</i>

127
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:52,437
<i>of your bouncing,
bad-ass baby brother.</i>

128
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,481
Start tight and then go wide.

129
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,024
<i>Stamp date and time.</i>

130
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,194
<i>Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile
propulsion suit test.</i>

131
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,112
Initialise sequence.

132
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:05,492
Jarvis, drop my needle.

133
00:06:29,683 --> 00:06:30,976
Crap.

134
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:51,044
All right, I think we got this.
Send them all.

135
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:00,672
Probably a little fast.
Slow it down.

136
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:01,798
Slow it down just a...

137
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:03,174
little bit.

138
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,517
Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

139
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:25,614
Come on. I ain't scared of you.

140
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:34,247
I'm the best.

141
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,840
<i>As always, sir, a great pleasure
watching you work.</i>

142
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,802
<i>I guess 72 hours is a long time
between siestas.</i>

143
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,889
<i>I didn't think it could get any worse.</i>

144
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:55,268
<i>Then I had to go and turn on the TV.</i>

145
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:00,607
<i>That's when he happened.</i>

146
00:08:09,157 --> 00:08:11,534
<i>Some people call me a terrorist.</i>

147
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:16,915
<i>I consider myself a teacher.</i>

148
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,752
<i>America.</i>

149
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:25,048
<i>Ready for another lesson?</i>

150
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:30,345
<i>In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado,
the US military waited</i>

151
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:33,682
<i>until the friendly Cheyenne braves
had all gone hunting.</i>

152
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:38,061
<i>Waited to attack and slaughter
the families left behind</i>

153
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:41,439
<i>and claim their land.</i>

154
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:43,400
<i>39 hours ago,</i>

155
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:48,363
<i>the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait
was attacked.</i>

156
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,699
<i>I... I... I did that.</i>

157
00:08:50,907 --> 00:08:52,117
<i>A quaint military church</i>

158
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:55,662
<i>filled with wives and children,
of course.</i>

159
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:00,709
<i>The soldiers were out on maneuvers.</i>

160
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,045
<i>The braves were</i> away.

161
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,589
<i>President Ellis.</i>

162
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:10,051
<i>You continue to resist my attempts
to educate you, sir.</i>

163
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,846
<i>And now you've missed me again.</i>

164
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,809
<i>You know who I am.</i>

165
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:19,978
<i>You don't know where I am.</i>

166
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:23,982
<i>And you'll never see me coming.</i>

167
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,611
<i>Now that we seem to be back,</i>

168
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:30,196
<i>let's recap some
of the frightening developments...</i>

169
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:32,157
<i>American airwaves were hijacked...</i>

170
00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:33,825
<i>The nation remains on high alert.</i>

171
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:36,633
<i>All attempts to find the Mandarin
have so far proved unsuccessful.</i>

172
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,998
<i>Central to my administration's
response to this terrorist event</i>

173
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,208
<i>is a newly minted resource.</i>

174
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,545
<i>I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.</i>

175
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,797
<i>The American people
will soon know him</i>

176
00:09:47,964 --> 00:09:49,507
<i>as the Iron Patriot.</i>

177
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,469
<i>And how is President Ellis responding?</i>

178
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,721
<i>By taking the guy
they call War Machine</i>

179
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,431
<i>and giving him a paint job.</i>

180
00:09:56,598 --> 00:10:00,185
<i>The same suit,
but painted red, white and blue.</i>

181
00:10:00,268 --> 00:10:04,147
<i>Look at that. And they also
renamed him, "Iron Patriot."</i>

182
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,150
<i>You know,
just in case the paint was too subtle.</i>

183
00:10:07,484 --> 00:10:09,319
It tested well with focus groups,
all right?

184
00:10:09,486 --> 00:10:11,112
"I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.

185
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,614
"War Machine" was
a little too aggressive.

186
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:14,217
All right?
This sends a better message.

187
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:19,537
So, what's really going on?
With the Mandarin.

188
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,041
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

189
00:10:26,002 --> 00:10:28,671
It's classified information, Tony.

190
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,257
Okay, there have been nine bombings.

191
00:10:31,508 --> 00:10:33,551
- Nine.
- The public only knows about three.

192
00:10:33,635 --> 00:10:36,721
But here's the thing,
nobody can ID a device.

193
00:10:36,888 --> 00:10:37,931
There's no bomb casings.

194
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,308
You know I can help. Just ask.

195
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,101
I got a ton of new tech.
I got a prehensile suit.

196
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,563
I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.

197
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,148
When's the last time
you got a good night's sleep?

198
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,901
Einstein slept three hours a year.
Look what he did.

199
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,549
People are concerned about you, Tony.
I'm concerned about you.

200
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:53,738
You're going to come at me like that?

201
00:10:53,947 --> 00:10:55,448
I'm not trying to be a dick...

202
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,158
tator.

203
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:58,743
Do you mind signing my drawing?

204
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:01,204
If Richard doesn't mind.
Are you all right with this, Dick?

205
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,872
Yeah. Fine with me.

206
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,334
- What's your name?
- Erin.

207
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,421
I loved you in <i>A</i> Christmas Story,
by the way.

208
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,091
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.

209
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:16,010
After New York, aliens... Come on.

210
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:17,762
They need to look strong.

211
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:21,015
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority,
but it's not...

212
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,892
- It's not superhero business.
- No, it's not, quite frankly.

213
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,519
- I get it.
- It's American business.

214
00:11:24,602 --> 00:11:26,437
That's why I said I got it.

215
00:11:27,188 --> 00:11:28,606
Are you okay?

216
00:11:29,274 --> 00:11:30,316
I broke the crayon.

217
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,110
Are you okay, Mr Stark?

218
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:34,028
Take it easy. Tony.

219
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,198
How did you get out of the Wormhole?

220
00:11:37,907 --> 00:11:38,950
Wait a minute. Tony!

221
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:40,115
- What did you say?
- Tony.

222
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:42,745
Sorry.

223
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:44,372
I'm just checking on the suit.

224
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:46,457
Okay.

225
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,129
Check the heart.

226
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:52,630
Is it the brain?

227
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:55,633
<i>No sign of cardiac anomaly
or unusual brain activity.</i>

228
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,552
Okay, so I was poisoned?

229
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:02,974
<i>My diagnosis is that you've
experienced a severe anxiety attack.</i>

230
00:12:05,476 --> 00:12:06,603
Me?

231
00:12:07,145 --> 00:12:08,945
Come on, man, this isn't a good look.
Open up.

232
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,940
Sorry, I gotta split.

233
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,277
Badge.

234
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:15,737
Badge.

235
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:18,197
Come on, badge.

236
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,118
Badge, guys.
I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.

237
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,495
Tony has got them in his basement.
They're wearing party hats.

238
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,664
This is an asset that we can put to use.

239
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,793
So, you're suggesting that I replace
the entire janitorial staff with robots.

240
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,462
- Thank you.
- What I'm saying is that

241
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:35,632
the human element of human resources
is our biggest point of vulnerability.

242
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:38,051
We should start
phasing it out immediately.

243
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:39,594
- What?
- Excuse me, Bambi,

244
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:40,970
- you should be wearing...
- Did you just say that?

245
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:42,639
- Security? Yes?
- Happy? Okay.

246
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:45,433
I am thrilled that you are now
the Head Of Security. Okay?

247
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,226
- It is the perfect position for you.
- Thank you.

248
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,853
- However...
- I do appreciate it.

249
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,855
- Since you've taken the post...
- You don't have to thank me.

250
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:54,442
We've had a rise in staff complaints
of 300%.

251
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,610
Thank you.

252
00:12:56,152 --> 00:12:57,236
It's not a compliment.

253
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,571
It's not... It is a compliment.

254
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:00,198
Clearly, somebody's
trying to hide something.

255
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,491
- I... Yes.
- Excuse me.

256
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,534
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.

257
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,036
- Thank you.
- Did you clear this 4:00 with me?

258
00:13:05,203 --> 00:13:06,913
Happy, we'll talk about this later,

259
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:09,476
but right now, I have to go deal with
this very annoying thing.

260
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,833
How so?

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,480
I used to work with him
and he used to ask me out all the time,

262
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:14,545
so it's a little awkward.

263
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,464
I don't like the sound of that.

264
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,470
Pepper

265
00:13:23,429 --> 00:13:24,430
Killian?

266
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,265
You look great.

267
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:27,976
You look really great.

268
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,311
God, you look great.

269
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:31,604
I... I.. I.

270
00:13:32,188 --> 00:13:33,548
What on earth have you been doing?

271
00:13:33,898 --> 00:13:34,899
Nothing fancy.

272
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,276
Just five years in the hands
of physical therapists.

273
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:39,320
And please, call me Aldrich.

274
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:41,572
You were supposed to be
issued a security badge.

275
00:13:41,864 --> 00:13:44,117
- Happy, it's okay. We're good.
- Yes.

276
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,744
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes. Stand down.

277
00:13:46,911 --> 00:13:48,951
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay.
- Thank you.

278
00:13:49,122 --> 00:13:51,833
It's very nice to see you, Killian.

279
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,549
Hey, guy.

280
00:14:07,223 --> 00:14:08,224
Merry Christmas.

281
00:14:08,558 --> 00:14:13,563
After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,

282
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:14,981
my think tank

283
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,110
now has a little something
in the pipeline.

284
00:14:19,986 --> 00:14:24,073
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.

285
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,479
I'm gonna turn your lights down.

286
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,122
Regard the human brain.

287
00:14:37,462 --> 00:14:38,504
Wait, hold on, hold on.

288
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,548
That's...
That's the universe. My bad.

289
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:42,508
But if I do that...

290
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,140
That's the brain.

291
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,642
Strangely mimetic, though,
wouldn't you say?

292
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,061
Wow, that's amazing.

293
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:54,812
Thanks, it's mine.

294
00:14:54,896 --> 00:14:56,147
What?

295
00:14:56,814 --> 00:14:58,107
This. You're inside my head.

296
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,276
It's a... It's a live feed.

297
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,195
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

298
00:15:03,821 --> 00:15:04,989
Come on.

299
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:08,993
Now, pinch my arm.

300
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:12,163
I can take it. Pinch me.

301
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:14,582
What is that?

302
00:15:14,874 --> 00:15:18,002
It's the primary somatosensory cortex.
It's the brain's pain centre.

303
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:21,589
But this is what I wanted to show you.

304
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:28,346
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses
our bioelectrical potential

305
00:15:28,513 --> 00:15:31,349
and it goes here.

306
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:34,644
This is essentially an empty slot
and what this tells us

307
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:36,521
is that our mind,

308
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,106
our entire DNA, in fact,

309
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,108
is destined to be upgraded.

310
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:41,359
Wow.

311
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:44,153
Wait...

312
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:51,410
Hello?

313
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,371
- Is this Forehead Of Security?
- What?

314
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,206
You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

315
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:56,582
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

316
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:57,792
What, harassing interns?

317
00:15:57,875 --> 00:15:59,168
<i>Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</i>

318
00:15:59,252 --> 00:16:00,253
<i>when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</i>

319
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,296
<i>They would laugh in my face.</i>

320
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,757
<i>I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</i>

321
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,676
<i>Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</i>

322
00:16:06,843 --> 00:16:08,553
What's going on? Fill me in.

323
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:09,846
<i>- For real?
- Yeah.</i>

324
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:11,514
<i>All right.
She's meeting up with this scientist.</i>

325
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,224
- Rich guy. Handsome.
- Right.

326
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:15,726
<i>I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</i>

327
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:16,811
- Yeah, you're the best.
- Yeah.

328
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,229
<i>Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</i>

329
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,857
<i>Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</i>

330
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:23,568
<i>Where were we in '99?
The science conference?</i>

331
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:26,195
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

332
00:16:26,404 --> 00:16:27,780
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

333
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,365
Of course you don't remember him.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

334
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,075
<i>At first, it was fine.
They were talking business.</i>

335
00:16:31,242 --> 00:16:34,328
But now it's getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

336
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,164
<i>- His</i> what?
<i>- Big brain.</i>

337
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:37,807
<i>And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</i>

338
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:39,876
Hold on. See?

339
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:41,779
<i>Look at what? You, watching them?</i>

340
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,554
<i>Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</i>

341
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,465
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

342
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:48,301
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

343
00:16:48,467 --> 00:16:49,594
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

344
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,430
<i>Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</i>

345
00:16:52,889 --> 00:16:54,169
<i>All right? I don't work for you.</i>

346
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:56,642
<i>And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</i>

347
00:16:56,726 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>He's shifty.</i>

348
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:58,853
<i>- Relax.
- Seriously?</i>

349
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,438
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

350
00:17:00,646 --> 00:17:01,856
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

351
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,608
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

352
00:17:03,941 --> 00:17:05,443
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

353
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,944
and you're just ignoring her.

354
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,112
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.

355
00:17:08,196 --> 00:17:09,530
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

356
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:12,294
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

357
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,890
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

358
00:17:14,577 --> 00:17:15,620
I miss you, Happy.

359
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:17,788
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

360
00:17:18,122 --> 00:17:19,123
<i>Now you're off with the super-friends.</i>

361
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:20,416
<i>I don't know what's going on
with you any more.</i>

362
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,542
<i>- The world's getting weird.
- Hey!</i>

363
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:22,627
I hate to cut you off.

364
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,711
- Do you have your Taser on you?
<i>- Why?</i>

365
00:17:23,794 --> 00:17:26,005
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

366
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,174
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

367
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:29,550
<i>Yeah, nice.</i>

368
00:17:30,051 --> 00:17:34,472
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

369
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,599
and recode its DNA.

370
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:38,684
That would be incredible.

371
00:17:38,851 --> 00:17:42,480
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.

372
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:46,234
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

373
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,985
Tony, TOW-

374
00:17:49,028 --> 00:17:53,783
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

375
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:54,909
He turned me down.

376
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:59,455
But something tells me,
now there's a new genius on the throne

377
00:17:59,538 --> 00:18:02,792
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more

378
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,835
and who has slightly less of an ego.

379
00:18:06,379 --> 00:18:08,923
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

380
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,385
As much as I'd like to help you.

381
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:17,014
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

382
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,808
But then, as my father used to say,

383
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,644
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

384
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,187
That's very deep.

385
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:24,689
And I have no idea what it means.

386
00:18:24,897 --> 00:18:28,651
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

387
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:31,696
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

388
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,456
Happy-

389
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,626
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.

390
00:18:48,004 --> 00:18:49,463
Yes, I just...

391
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:52,967
God, I forgot my other things, so...

392
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:55,177
I'm just gonna...

393
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:23,914
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...

394
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,374
What the... What is that?

395
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:28,961
You're wearing this in the house now?

396
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,629
What is that, like, Mark 15?

397
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,508
Yeah. Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

398
00:19:34,592 --> 00:19:36,802
And you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

399
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,596
Just breaking it in.

400
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:41,807
You know, it's always a little pinchy
in the gooey bag at first, so...

401
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:44,060
Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

402
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:45,478
Yes, I did. I...

403
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,064
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

404
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,191
Is it gonna fit through the door?

405
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:51,609
Well, actually, it's a good question.

406
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:54,236
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow.
They're gonna blow out that wall.

407
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,780
- Okay.
- So...

408
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,531
Tense? Good day? Huh?

409
00:19:57,615 --> 00:20:00,284
Shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

410
00:20:00,368 --> 00:20:03,954
I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

411
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:05,164
Did I like it?

412
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:06,999
- Nailed it, right?
- Wow.

413
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,877
I appreciate the thought very much.

414
00:20:11,087 --> 00:20:14,548
So, why don't you lift up that face mask
and give me a kiss?

415
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,345
Yep. Damn it, no can do.

416
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:23,307
You want to just kiss it
on the... The facial slit?

417
00:20:23,391 --> 00:20:25,393
Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

418
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:28,062
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?

419
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,814
Crowbar, yeah.

420
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:32,233
Except there's been a radiation leak.

421
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,235
- I'll take my chances.
- That's risky.

422
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,446
At least, let me get you, like,
a hazmat suit.

423
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:40,908
A Geiger counter or something like that.

424
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:43,119
Busted.

425
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:46,789
- This is a new level of lame.
- Sorry.

426
00:20:46,956 --> 00:20:49,333
You ate without me already?
On date night?

427
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:51,449
- He was just...
- You mean you.

428
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:54,171
Well, yeah, I just mean
we were hosting you...

429
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,174
while I finished up a little work.

430
00:20:57,341 --> 00:20:58,551
And yes, I had a quick bite.

431
00:20:58,634 --> 00:20:59,593
I didn't know if you were coming home

432
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,517
or you were having drinks
with Aldrich Killian.

433
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:06,559
- What?
- What?

434
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,228
Aldrich Killian?
What, are you checking up on me?

435
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:10,312
Happy was concerned.

436
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:11,522
- You're spying on me.
- I wasn't.

437
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:12,765
- I'm going to bed.
- Hold on.

438
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:15,276
Come on. Pep?

439
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,360
Hey, I admit it.

440
00:21:16,527 --> 00:21:19,488
My fault. Sorry.

441
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm a piping hot mess.

442
00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:27,872
It's been going on for a while.
I haven't said anything.

443
00:21:28,706 --> 00:21:30,458
Nothing's been the same
since New York.

444
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,004
Really? I didn't notice that at all.

445
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,673
You experience things

446
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,956
and then they're over,
and you still can't explain them.

447
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:44,638
Gods, aliens, other dimensions.
I'm just a man in a can.

448
00:21:44,722 --> 00:21:46,162
The only reason I haven't cracked up

449
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,142
is probably because you moved in.

450
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:49,643
Which is great.

451
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,270
I love you. I'm lucky.

452
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:54,315
But honey, I can't sleep.

453
00:21:55,608 --> 00:21:58,736
You go to bed, I come down here.
I do what I know.

454
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,571
I tinker. I...

455
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:03,491
Threat is imminent.

456
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:07,203
And I have to protect the one thing
that I can't live without.

457
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,996
That's you.

458
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,332
And my suits, they're...

459
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,416
Machines.

460
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,251
They're part of me.

461
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:16,504
A distraction.

462
00:22:17,171 --> 00:22:18,672
Maybe.

463
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,359
I'm gonna take a shower.

464
00:22:38,442 --> 00:22:40,152
Okay.

465
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:43,614
And you're gonna join me.

466
00:22:45,407 --> 00:22:46,742
Better.

467
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:06,512
Tony.

468
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,640
Tony. Tony.

469
00:23:10,474 --> 00:23:12,101
To...

470
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,522
Power down!

471
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:26,323
I must have called it in my sleep.

472
00:23:26,407 --> 00:23:28,701
That's not supposed to happen.

473
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,205
I'll recalibrate the sensors.

474
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:38,085
Can we just... Just let me...

475
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,588
Just let me catch my breath. Hey,
don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...

476
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:42,798
I'm going to sleep downstairs.

477
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:45,134
Tinker with that.

478
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:12,828
Can you regulate?

479
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:13,995
Yes, I can regulate.

480
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:15,164
- You sure about that?
- Yes.

481
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:27,134
It's a decent batch.

482
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:30,674
- Don't say I never did nothing for you.
- Thank you.

483
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,142
I mean, for understanding.

484
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:44,735
I'm sorry, buddy.

485
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,127
What are you doing, buddy?

486
00:25:02,211 --> 00:25:03,545
You out by yourself?
A little date night?

487
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:05,229
Seeing your favourite
chick flick, maybe?

488
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:07,015
Yeah, a little movie
called The <i>Party's</i> Over,

489
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,967
starring you and your junkie girlfriend.

490
00:25:09,051 --> 00:25:10,052
Here's the ticket.

491
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:12,488
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

492
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:39,957
Savin!

493
00:25:40,958 --> 00:25:42,126
Help!

494
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,002
Help me!

495
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:12,174
<i>True story about fortune cookies.</i>

496
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:13,592

Hi.

509
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:10,893
Do you mind leaving that on?

510
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:12,693
Sure.

511
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:23,120
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton <i>Abbey.</i>

512
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:26,832
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.

513
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:31,545
One more thing. Make sure
everyone wears their badges.

514
00:28:31,628 --> 00:28:32,838
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.

515
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:36,049
Plus, my guys
won't let anyone in without them.

516
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,176
We're awaiting the arrival
of Tony Stark.

517
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,900
We're hoping he'll give us
the reaction...

518
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:41,513
His reaction
to the latest attack.

519
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:44,182
Mr Stark, hi there.

520
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:47,519
Our sources are telling us that all signs
are pointing to another Mandarin attack.

521
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:49,730
Anything else you can tell us?

522
00:28:49,813 --> 00:28:52,816
Hey, Mr Stark.
When is somebody gonna kill this guy?

523
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:54,651
I'm just saying.

524
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,781
Is that what you want?

525
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,660
Here's a little holiday greeting

526
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:06,163
I've been wanting to send
to the Mandarin.

527
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:08,624
I just didn't know
how to phrase it until now.

528
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,377
My name is Tony Stark
and I'm not afraid of you.

529
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:15,505
I know you're a coward.
So I've decided

530
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,841
that you just died, pal.

531
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:20,052
I'm gonna come get the body.

532
00:29:20,344 --> 00:29:22,888
There's no politics here.
It's just good old-fashioned revenge.

533
00:29:23,513 --> 00:29:26,183
There's no Pentagon,
it's just you and me.

534
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:30,103
And on the off chance you're a man,
here's my home address.

535
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,690
10880 Malibu Point.

536
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,943
90265.

537
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:37,861
I'll leave the door unlocked.

538
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:39,145
That's what you wanted, right?

539
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,034
Bill me.

540
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:51,458
<i>I've compiled
a Mandarin database for you, sir,</i>

541
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:55,754
<i>drawn from
S.H.l.E.I.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.</i>

542
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:58,382
<i>Initiating virtual crime scene
reconstruction.</i>

543
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,346
Okay. What have we got here?

544
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,767
The name is an ancient Chinese war
mantle meaning "advisor to the king."

545
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,145
South American insurgency tactics.

546
00:30:12,229 --> 00:30:14,690
Talks like a Baptist preacher.

547
00:30:14,773 --> 00:30:19,111
There's lots of pageantry going on here.
Lots of theatre. Close.

548
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:22,781
<i>The heat from the blast was in excess
of 3,000 degrees Celsius.</i>

549
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:26,493
<i>Any subjects within 12.5 yards
were vaporised instantly.</i>

550
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,246
No bomb parts found in a three-mile
radius of the Chinese Theatre?

551
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,330
<i>No, sir.</i>

552
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:33,375
Talk to me, Happy.

553
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,021
When is a bomb not a bomb?

554
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:06,450
Any military victims?

555
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,099
<i>Not according to public record, sir.</i>

556
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,288
Bring up
the thermogenic signatures again.

557
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,081
Factor in 3,000 degrees.

558
00:31:13,165 --> 00:31:15,876
<i>The Oracle cloud
has completed analysis.</i>

559
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:17,044
<i>Accessing satellites</i>

560
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:21,006
<i>and plotting the last 12 months
of thermogenic occurrences now.</i>

561
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:24,134
Take away everywhere
that there's been a Mandarin attack.

562
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,599
Nope.

563
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,732
That.
Are you sure that's not one of his?

564
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,276
<i>It predates any known Mandarin attack.</i>

565
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,196
<i>The incident was the use of a bomb
to assist a suicide.</i>

566
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,114
Bring her around.

567
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:49,201
<i>The heat signature
is remarkably similar.</i>

568
00:31:49,868 --> 00:31:51,328
<i>3,000 degree Celsius.</i>

569
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,207
That's two military guys.

570
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:57,239
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

571
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,170
<i>Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.</i>

572
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,260
Are we still at ding-dong?

573
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:09,763
We're supposed to be on total...

574
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:10,972
security lockdown.

575
00:32:11,056 --> 00:32:12,896
Come on, I threatened a terrorist.
Who is that?

576
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:15,602
<i>There's only so much I can do, sir,</i>

577
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:19,606
<i>when you give the world's press
your home address.</i>

578
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,867
Right there is fine.

579
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:36,581
You're not the Mandarin.

580
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:38,750
Are you? Are you?

581
00:32:40,293 --> 00:32:41,920
You don't remember.

582
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:43,130
Why am I not surprised?

583
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:45,465
Don't take it personally. I don't
remember what I had for breakfast.

584
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,008
<i>Gluten-free waffles, sir.</i>

585
00:32:47,092 --> 00:32:48,385
That's right.

586
00:32:48,593 --> 00:32:51,388
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you,
someplace not here.

587
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:52,472
It's urgent.

588
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:58,770
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing,
but now I'm in a committed relationship.

589
00:32:58,854 --> 00:32:59,896
It's...

590
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:02,732
- With her.
- Tony?

591
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,279
- Is somebody there?
- Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.

592
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:09,406
Old botanist pal

593
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:11,867
that I used to know, barely.

594
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,660
Please don't tell me
there's a 12-year-old kid

595
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,828
waiting in the car that I've never met.

596
00:33:14,911 --> 00:33:15,912
He's 13.

597
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:17,789
No, I need your help.

598
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:19,457
But, what for? Why now?

599
00:33:19,541 --> 00:33:22,794
Because I read the papers, and frankly,
I don't think you'll last the week.

600
00:33:22,878 --> 00:33:23,920
I'll be fine.

601
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:27,465
I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.

602
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:29,426
- We weren't.
- And old girlfriends.

603
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,261
- She's not, really.
- No, not really.

604
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:34,514
- It was just one night.
- Yep.

605
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,308
That's how you did it, isn't it?

606
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:38,727
- It was a great night.
- Yep. Well, you know.

607
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:40,729
- You saved yourself a world of pain.
- What?

608
00:33:40,812 --> 00:33:42,397
- I'm sure.
- Trust me. We're going out of town.

609
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,481
Okay. We've been through this.

610
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,608
- Nope.
- Yep!

611
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,651
- The man says no.
- Immediately and indefinitely.

612
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,236
- Honey...
- Great idea. Let's go.

613
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,947
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea.
Please don't touch her bags.

614
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,532
This is how normal people behave.

615
00:33:52,741 --> 00:33:54,784
I can't protect you out there.

616
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:56,703
Is... ls that normal?

617
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:58,955
- Sadly, that is very normal.
- Yes, this is normal!

618
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,707
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!

619
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,042
Calm down.

620
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,044
- I got this for you.
- I'm aware of that.

621
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,462
You still haven't even
told me you liked it.

622
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:06,838
I don't like it.

623
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:07,923
I asked you three...
You don't like it.

624
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:09,216
- We are leaving the house.
- Guys?

625
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:10,383
That's not even up for discussion.

626
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,677
- Can we...
- I said no. What?

627
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:14,001
Do we need to worry about that?

628
00:35:03,478 --> 00:35:04,479
<i>I</i> 9011 you.

629
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,731
I got you first.

630
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,149
Like I said, we can't stay here.

631
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,536
Move! I'm right behind you.

632
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:25,228
Get her. I'm gonna find a way around.

633
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,566
Stop stopping. Get her. Get outside.

634
00:35:28,378 --> 00:35:29,671
Go!

635
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,778
Oh, my God. Tony!

636
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:10,920
<i>Sir, Ms Potts
is clear of the structure.</i>

637
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:44,371
Jarvis, where's my flight power?

638
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,498
<i>Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.</i>

639
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,597
That's one.

640
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:07,102
<i>Sir, the suit is not combat ready.</i>

641
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:24,202
That's two.

642
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:39,068
Tony!

643
00:39:12,936 --> 00:39:14,604
<i>Sir, take a deep breath.</i>

644
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,163
<i>Flight power restored.</i>

645
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:48,638
<i>Sir?</i>

646
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:50,431
<i>Sir!</i>

647
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,560
All right, kill the alarm. I got it.

648
00:39:53,643 --> 00:39:57,689
<i>That's the emergency alert triggered by
the power dropping below 5%.</i>

649
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:37,645
It's snowing, right?
Where are we, upstate?

650
00:40:37,729 --> 00:40:41,441
<i>We are five miles outside of
Rose Hill, Tennessee.</i>

651
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:42,942
<i>Why'?</i>

652
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,695
Jarvis. Not my idea.

653
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:48,489
What are we doing here?
This is thousands of miles away!

654
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:49,991
I gotta get Pepper-

655
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,827
<i>I prepared a flight plan.
This was the location.</i>

656
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,911
Who asked you?

657
00:40:54,704 --> 00:40:55,955
Open the suit.

658
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,248
<i>I... I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.</i>

659
00:40:57,332 --> 00:40:58,333
Open it, J.

660
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,507
That's brisk.

661
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,309
Maybe I'll just cosy back up for a...

662
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:19,312
<i>I actually think
I need to sleep now, sir.</i>

663
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:20,980
Jarvis.

664
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,567
Jarvis?

665
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,238
Don't leave me, buddy.

666
00:41:50,259 --> 00:41:54,597
<i>Stark secure server now transferring
to all known receivers.</i>

667
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:56,015
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

668
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:59,394
I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.

669
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:02,355
So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.

670
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:06,192
That was selfish and stupid,
and it won't happen again.

671
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:09,362
Also, it's Christmastime
and the rabbit's too big.

672
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,447
Done. Sorry.

673
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:14,534
And I'm sorry in advance

674
00:42:14,617 --> 00:42:16,577
because I can't come home yet.

675
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,789
<i>I need to find this guy.</i>

676
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,709
<i>You gotta stay safe, that's all I know.</i>

677
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,129
<i>I just stole a poncho
from a wooden Indian.</i>

678
00:42:50,361 --> 00:42:51,654
Let's get you comfy.

679
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:56,367
You happy now?

680
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:07,754
Freeze!

681
00:43:09,714 --> 00:43:11,340
Don't move.

682
00:43:12,008 --> 00:43:13,342
You got me.

683
00:43:14,927 --> 00:43:16,596
Nice potato gun.

684
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,264
Barrel's a little long.

685
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:22,268
Between that and the wide gauge,
it's gonna diminish your FPS.

686
00:43:26,439 --> 00:43:27,690
And now you're out of ammo.

687
00:43:28,691 --> 00:43:30,234
What's that thing on your chest?

688
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:33,446
It's an electromagnet.

689
00:43:33,529 --> 00:43:35,489
You should know,
you got a box of them right here.

690
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:37,033
What does it power?

691
00:43:46,042 --> 00:43:47,960
Oh, my God.

692
00:43:49,128 --> 00:43:50,254
That...

693
00:43:53,049 --> 00:43:54,675
That's... ls that Iron Man?

694
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:56,302
Technically, I am.

695
00:43:56,928 --> 00:43:59,055
Technically, you're dead.

696
00:44:01,057 --> 00:44:02,099
Valid point.

697
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:03,559
What happened to him?

698
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,061
Life.

699
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:07,730
I built him. I take care of him.

700
00:44:09,732 --> 00:44:10,733
I'll fix him.

701
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:11,859
Like a mechanic?

702
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:13,402
Yeah.

703
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,824
If I was building
Iron Man and War Machine...

704
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:18,991
It's "Iron Patriot" HOW-

705
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:20,243
That's way cooler.

706
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:21,661
No, it's not.

707
00:44:21,744 --> 00:44:25,790
Anyways, I would have added in
the retro...

708
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:28,459
- Retro-reflective panels?
- To make him stealth mode.

709
00:44:28,751 --> 00:44:30,461
- You want a stealth mode?
- Cool, right?

710
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:32,588
That's actually a good idea.
Maybe I'll build one.

711
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:34,006
- Not a good idea.
- Oops.

712
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,425
What are you doing?
You're gonna break his finger?

713
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:38,052
He's in pain. He's been injured.
Leave him alone.

714
00:44:38,177 --> 00:44:39,178
Sorry.

715
00:44:39,345 --> 00:44:40,763
Are you?

716
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:44,559
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.

717
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:46,352
So, who's home?

718
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:50,815
My mom already left for the diner,
and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.

719
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:54,944
I guess he won,
because that was six years ago.

720
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:58,906
Which happens. Dads leave.
No need to be a pussy about it.

721
00:44:58,990 --> 00:44:59,991
Here's what I need.

722
00:45:01,033 --> 00:45:03,536
A laptop, a digital watch,
a cell phone,

723
00:45:03,619 --> 00:45:06,038
the pneumatic actuator
from your bazooka over there,

724
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:09,500
a map of town, a big spring
and a tuna fish sandwich.

725
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,711
What's in it for me?

726
00:45:11,794 --> 00:45:14,547
- Salvation. What's his name?
- Who?

727
00:45:14,797 --> 00:45:18,050
The kid that bullies you at school.
What's his name?

728
00:45:18,134 --> 00:45:19,635
How'd you know that?

729
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:21,971
I got just the thing.

730
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:27,268
This is a <i>piñata</i> for a cricket.

731
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:29,071
I'm kidding.
This is a very powerful weapon.

732
00:45:29,145 --> 00:45:32,398
Point it away from your face,
press the button on top,

733
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:33,566
it discourages bullying.

734
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:37,987
Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.
Deal?

735
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,488
Deal? What do you say?

736
00:45:39,655 --> 00:45:41,407
- Deal.
- Deal?

737
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:43,868
What's your name?

738
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:46,495
Harley. And you're...

739
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:47,955
The mechanic.

740
00:45:48,998 --> 00:45:50,249
Tony.

741
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:54,211
You know what keeps
going through my head?

742
00:45:54,295 --> 00:45:55,880
"Where's my sandwich?"

743
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:06,182
Where is Tony Stark?

744
00:46:34,752 --> 00:46:38,255
<i>Stark secure server.
Retinal scan verified.</i>

745
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:39,465
<i>Pepper, it's me.</i>

746
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:42,468
<i>I've got a lot of apologies to make
and not a lot of time.</i>

747
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:45,596
<i>So... First off, I'm so sorry
I put you in harm's way.</i>

748
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,057
<i>That was selfish and stupid
and it won't happen again.</i>

749
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:51,836
Why were you at the house tonight?

750
00:46:53,229 --> 00:46:55,398
What was so important
that you had to speak to Tony?

751
00:46:59,235 --> 00:47:02,196
I think that my boss
is working for the Mandarin.

752
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:04,949
So, if you still want to talk about it

753
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:08,119
I suggest that we get
ourselves someplace safe.

754
00:47:09,412 --> 00:47:12,289
Your boss works for the Mandarin,
you think?

755
00:47:12,498 --> 00:47:14,583
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...

756
00:47:14,667 --> 00:47:17,420
That figures. What I actually am
is a biological DNA coder

757
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,839
running a team of 40
out of a privately funded think tank.

758
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:21,632
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

759
00:47:23,926 --> 00:47:26,053
This boss of yours,
does he have a name?

760
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:28,889
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

761
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:34,478
<i>We took the house down, sir.
But there's no sign of a body.</i>

762
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:35,604
- I see.
- No Stark.

763
00:47:36,063 --> 00:47:38,315
I have to go.

764
00:47:38,399 --> 00:47:40,651
The master is about to record
and he's a little...

765
00:47:41,569 --> 00:47:43,320
Well, you know how he gets.

766
00:47:43,404 --> 00:47:46,949
Keep your appointment tonight
and call me when it's done.

767
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:54,540
All right, everybody.
No talking and no eye contact.

768
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,917
Unless you want to get shot in the face.

769
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:09,638
Report in.

770
00:48:11,682 --> 00:48:12,683
Path is clear.

771
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:19,148
The master is travelling.

772
00:48:33,913 --> 00:48:37,041
Well, then, what are we waiting for?

773
00:48:39,293 --> 00:48:41,373
The sandwich was fair,
the spring was a little rusty,

774
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,839
the rest of the materials, I'll make do.

775
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,633
By the way,
when you said your sister had a watch...

776
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:46,876
- Yeah?
- I was kind of hoping

777
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,220
for something a little more
adult than that.

778
00:48:49,303 --> 00:48:52,932
She's six.
Anyway, it's a limited edition.

779
00:48:53,015 --> 00:48:54,433
When can we talk about New York?

780
00:48:54,517 --> 00:48:56,393
Maybe never. Relax about it.

781
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:57,937
What about the Avengers?
Can we talk about them?

782
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,231
I dunno. Later.
Hey, kid, give me a little space.

783
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,863
What's the official story here?
What happened?

784
00:49:07,947 --> 00:49:12,493
I guess this guy named Chad Davis
used to live roundabouts.

785
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,996
He won a bunch of medals in the army.

786
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,334
And one day, folks said he went crazy
and made, you know, a bomb.

787
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,087
Then he blew himself up, right here.

788
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,178
- Six people died, right?
- Yeah.

789
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:33,013
- Including Chad Davis.
- Yeah, yeah.

790
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:42,565
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

791
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:44,900
Think about it.

792
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:47,570
Six dead. Only five shadows.

793
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:49,155
Yeah.

794
00:49:49,238 --> 00:49:52,074
People said these shadows are
like the marks of souls going to heaven.

795
00:49:53,784 --> 00:49:55,536
Except the bomb guy.

796
00:49:55,619 --> 00:49:59,498
He went to hell,
on account of he didn't get a shadow.

797
00:49:59,582 --> 00:50:01,000
That's why there's only five.

798
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:04,044
- Do you buy that?
- It's what everyone says.

799
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,800
You know what
this crater reminds me of?

800
00:50:09,884 --> 00:50:12,344
No idea. I'm not...
I don't care.

801
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:18,058
That giant Wormhole in New York.

802
00:50:18,517 --> 00:50:20,561
Does it remind you?

803
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,688
That's manipulative.
I don't want to talk about it.

804
00:50:22,771 --> 00:50:24,732
Are they coming back? The aliens?

805
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:26,108
Maybe. Can you stop?

806
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:30,020
Remember what I told you,
that I have an anxiety issue?

807
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,864
Does this subject make you edgy?

808
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:34,200
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch
my breath for a second?

809
00:50:34,283 --> 00:50:36,118
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?

810
00:50:36,202 --> 00:50:38,621
Do you need a plastic bag
to breathe into?

811
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:40,497
- Do you have medication?
- No.

812
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,144
- Do you need to be on it?
- Probably.

813
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,542
- Do you have PTSD?
- I don't think so.

814
00:50:43,626 --> 00:50:45,127
Are you going completely mental?

815
00:50:45,836 --> 00:50:47,463
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

816
00:50:48,255 --> 00:50:49,465
Remember when I said
to stop doing that?

817
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,092
I swear that you're gonna freak me out.

818
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,513
Man, you did it, didn't you?
You happy now?

819
00:50:56,597 --> 00:50:57,640
What did I say?

820
00:50:58,182 --> 00:50:59,391
Hey! Wait up!

821
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:02,269
Wait, wait.

822
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:08,984
What the hell was that?

823
00:51:12,905 --> 00:51:15,157
Your fault. You spazzed me out.

824
00:51:16,825 --> 00:51:19,203
Okay, back to business.
Where were we?

825
00:51:19,286 --> 00:51:20,496
The guy who died.

826
00:51:20,788 --> 00:51:23,707
Relatives? Mom?
Mrs Davis, where is she?

827
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,833
Where she always is.

828
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:27,544
See? Now, you're being helpful.

829
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,051
Sorry.

830
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:35,594
Lady?

831
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:38,514
Is this...

832
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:40,557
Thank you.

833
00:51:43,102 --> 00:51:45,688
Nice haircut. It suits you.

834
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,231
Nice watch.

835
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,941
Yeah. A limited edition.

836
00:51:49,483 --> 00:51:51,527
I don't doubt it.

837
00:51:52,569 --> 00:51:53,821
Well, have a good evening.

838
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:07,543
Excuse me.

839
00:52:17,219 --> 00:52:18,887
Mrs Davis?

840
00:52:19,638 --> 00:52:20,639
Mind if I join you?

841
00:52:21,515 --> 00:52:22,516
Free country.

842
00:52:23,017 --> 00:52:24,476
Sure is.

843
00:52:29,064 --> 00:52:30,607
All right.

844
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:33,569
Where would you like to start?

845
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:37,114
I just want to say,
I'm sorry about your loss.

846
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:38,717
I want to know
what you think happened.

847
00:52:40,826 --> 00:52:45,748
Look, I brought your damn file.
You take it, go.

848
00:52:46,749 --> 00:52:50,502
Whatever was in here,
he wanted no part of it.

849
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,465
Clearly, you're waiting
for someone else. Huh?

850
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,790
Supposed to meet someone here?

851
00:52:55,883 --> 00:52:56,884
Yeah.

852
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:13,150
Mrs Davis,
your son didn't kill himself.

853
00:53:13,233 --> 00:53:15,110
I guarantee you, he didn't kill anyone.

854
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:17,946
Someone used him.

855
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:20,282
What?

856
00:53:20,949 --> 00:53:22,868
As a weapon.

857
00:53:26,622 --> 00:53:30,376
You're not the person
that called me after all, are you?

858
00:53:31,085 --> 00:53:32,294
Actually, I am.

859
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,635
Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about?
What the hell is going on here?

860
00:53:40,094 --> 00:53:41,720
It's called an arrest.

861
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,808
- Sheriff, is it?
- Yes, ma'am, it is. And you are?

862
00:53:45,891 --> 00:53:47,935
Homeland Security. We good here?

863
00:53:48,018 --> 00:53:49,853
No, we're not "good."

864
00:53:49,937 --> 00:53:51,617
I need a little more information
than that.

865
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,899
I think it's a little above
your pay grade, Sheriff.

866
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:57,444
Yeah? Why don't you get on the horn
to Nashville, and upgrade me?

867
00:53:57,736 --> 00:54:01,323
All right. You know what?
I was hoping to do this the smart way

868
00:54:01,907 --> 00:54:03,158
but the fun way is always good.

869
00:54:04,576 --> 00:54:06,036
Deputy, get this woman out of...

870
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:22,151
Hey, hot wings, you want to party?
Come on, you and me, let's go.

871
00:54:35,899 --> 00:54:37,860
- Crazy, huh?
- Yep.

872
00:54:39,361 --> 00:54:40,404
Watch this.

873
00:55:46,595 --> 00:55:50,390
You walked right into this one.
I've dated hotter chicks than you.

874
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:52,768
That's all you got?

875
00:55:54,269 --> 00:55:55,749
A cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

876
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:59,149
Sweetheart, that could be
the name of my autobiography.

877
00:56:59,835 --> 00:57:01,962
- Let me go!
- Help me!

878
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:07,342
Anyway-

879
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:10,596
Hey, kid,
what would you like for Christmas?

880
00:57:10,679 --> 00:57:12,639
Mr Stark, I am so sorry.

881
00:57:12,723 --> 00:57:13,932
No, no, no.
I think he was trying to say,

882
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:15,934
"I want my goddamn file."

883
00:57:16,351 --> 00:57:17,394
It's not your fault, kid.

884
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,898
Remember what I told you
about bullies?

885
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:29,573
You like that, Westworld?

886
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:31,433
That's the thing about smart guys,

887
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,994
we always cover our ass.

888
00:57:58,310 --> 00:58:00,103
You're welcome.

889
00:58:01,438 --> 00:58:02,773
For what? Did I miss something?

890
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:04,816
Me, saving your life.

891
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:08,028
Yeah. A, I saved you first.
B, thanks. Sort of.

892
00:58:08,111 --> 00:58:10,864
And C, if you do someone a solid,
don't be a yutz.

893
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:14,242
All right? Just play it cool.
Otherwise you come off grandiose.

894
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:16,119
Unlike you?

895
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:19,581
Admit it, you need me.

896
00:58:19,915 --> 00:58:21,208
We're connected.

897
00:58:21,416 --> 00:58:23,456
What I need is for you to go home,
be with your mom,

898
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,837
keep your trap shut, guard the suit,

899
00:58:25,921 --> 00:58:27,172
And stay connected to the telephone,

900
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:28,975
because if I call,
you better pick up. Okay?

901
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:32,177
Can you feel that? We're done here.

902
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,512
Move out of the way,
or I'm gonna run you over.

903
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:35,305
Bye, kid.

904
00:58:41,895 --> 00:58:43,397
I'm sorry, kid.

905
00:58:44,106 --> 00:58:45,107
You did good.

906
00:58:45,607 --> 00:58:48,068
So, now you're just gonna
leave me here, like my dad?

907
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:51,196
Yeah.

908
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:54,032
Wait, you're guilt-tripping me,
aren't you?

909
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,742
I'm cold.

910
00:58:56,034 --> 00:58:58,286
I can tell. You know how I can tell?

911
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:01,289
Because we're connected.

912
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:07,212
It was worth a shot.

913
00:59:20,058 --> 00:59:21,977
<i>You get this.
It's affordable. It's gorgeous.</i>

914
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,437
<i>It goes with any décor...</i>

915
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:27,649
- What happened to picture?
- Go to override.

916
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,737
- How is this happening again?
- Fine. Override to Los Angeles.

917
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,821
<i>I'm trying. There's nothing I can...</i>

918
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:33,905
<i>Well, where is the feed coming from?</i>

919
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:36,156
<i>I don't know,
it's in all of our receivers and</i> I...

920
00:59:36,158 --> 00:59:38,285
The entire East Coast,
the satellites are down.

921
00:59:38,368 --> 00:59:39,703
It's not just our station.

922
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:40,871
What about a backup manual?

923
00:59:41,037 --> 00:59:43,077
<i>We have an unauthorised
broadcast cutting through...</i>

924
00:59:43,206 --> 00:59:47,043
Mr Vice President,
I think you should see this.

925
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:50,505
Oh, God, not again.

926
00:59:51,131 --> 00:59:52,340
Is the President getting this?

927
01:00:03,435 --> 01:00:05,187
<i>Mr President.</i>

928
01:00:05,604 --> 01:00:07,439
<i>Only two lessons remain.</i>

929
01:00:08,148 --> 01:00:11,568
<i>And I intend to finish this
before Christmas morning.</i>

930
01:00:12,027 --> 01:00:14,404
<i>Meet Thomas Richards.</i>

931
01:00:14,488 --> 01:00:17,657
<i>Good strong name. Good strong job.</i>

932
01:00:18,241 --> 01:00:23,538
<i>Thomas, here, is an accountant
for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.</i>

933
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:28,543
But I'm sure he's a really good guy.

934
01:00:30,879 --> 01:00:32,279
I'm going to shoot him in the head,

935
01:00:32,714 --> 01:00:35,634
live on your television, in 30 seconds.

936
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:36,843
No!

937
01:00:36,927 --> 01:00:40,305
The number for this telephone
is in your cell phone.

938
01:00:40,388 --> 01:00:43,517
Exciting, isn't it,
imagining how it got there?

939
01:00:43,725 --> 01:00:45,352
<i>America,</i>

940
01:00:45,644 --> 01:00:48,563
<i>if your president calls me
in the next half-minute,</i>

941
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:50,357
<i>Tom lives.</i>

942
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,441
<i>Go!</i>

943
01:00:53,735 --> 01:00:55,028
How did he hack my phone?

944
01:00:55,111 --> 01:00:57,072
We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

945
01:00:57,155 --> 01:00:58,406
I have to make this call.

946
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,893
I'd strongly advise against that.

947
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:02,577
This is the right thing to do.

948
01:01:29,104 --> 01:01:31,565
<i>There's just one lesson left,
President Ellis.</i>

949
01:01:31,648 --> 01:01:33,525
So run away, hide,
kiss your children goodbye.

950
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:34,609
Because nothing,

951
01:01:34,693 --> 01:01:37,112
not your army, not your red, white
and blue attack dog,

952
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:39,197
can save YOU.

953
01:01:41,575 --> 01:01:43,660
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

954
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:49,124
Tell Rhodes,
find this lunatic right now.

955
01:01:49,207 --> 01:01:50,917
Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal.

956
01:01:51,001 --> 01:01:52,836
We have a possible point of origin
in Pakistan

957
01:01:52,919 --> 01:01:54,045
and the Patriot is ready to strike.

958
01:01:54,129 --> 01:01:56,298
- Right now.
- Yes, sir.

959
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:12,147
Man. Happy, Happy, Happy.

960
01:02:26,578 --> 01:02:28,204
Don't move!

961
01:02:34,502 --> 01:02:35,503
Hang on a second.

962
01:02:36,379 --> 01:02:37,380
Hello?

963
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,215
You ever have a chick straddling you,
and you look up

964
01:02:39,299 --> 01:02:43,136
and suddenly she's glowing from
the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

965
01:02:43,428 --> 01:02:44,748
Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

966
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:45,804
<i>It's me, pal.</i>

967
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:48,007
Now, last time I went missing,
if I remember correctly,

968
01:02:48,016 --> 01:02:50,018
you came looking for me.
What are you doing?

969
01:02:50,101 --> 01:02:51,478
A little knock-and-talk,
making friends in Pakistan.

970
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:52,562
What are you doing?

971
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:55,774
Your redesign, your big rebrand,
that was AIM, right?

972
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:56,858
Yeah.

973
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:00,928
I'm gonna find a heavy-duty
comm sat now, I need your login.

974
01:03:01,112 --> 01:03:03,156
It's the same as it's always been,
"WarMachine68."

975
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:04,323
And password, please.

976
01:03:04,366 --> 01:03:06,446
Look, I gotta change it
every time you hack in, Tony.

977
01:03:06,576 --> 01:03:08,828
It's not the 80s,
nobody says "hack" any more.

978
01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:09,913
Give me your login.

979
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:13,959
"WAR MACHINE ROX"
with an all caps.

980
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:18,672
Yeah, okay.

981
01:03:18,964 --> 01:03:22,008
That is so much better
than "Iron Patriot."

982
01:03:30,058 --> 01:03:31,685
<i>Very nice. Very nice.</i>

983
01:03:31,977 --> 01:03:34,479
<i>I have one question for you.</i>

984
01:03:34,604 --> 01:03:37,107
<i>What would you like
for Christmas this year?</i>

985
01:03:38,858 --> 01:03:40,235
<i>Well, David...</i>

986
01:03:42,487 --> 01:03:47,117
Do not erase a programme from
my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

987
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,499
<i>One more time!
Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.</i>

988
01:03:56,543 --> 01:03:59,212
Because you erase my shows!

989
01:04:03,508 --> 01:04:05,010
That ain't gonna cut it.

990
01:04:05,260 --> 01:04:07,220
We talked about this.

991
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,807
Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...

992
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:16,127
Mom, I need to call you back.
Something magical is happening.

993
01:04:17,147 --> 01:04:19,065
- Tony Stark is in my van.
- Keep it down.

994
01:04:19,149 --> 01:04:20,789
- Tony Stark is in my van!
- No, he's not.

995
01:04:20,817 --> 01:04:21,937
I knew you were still alive!

996
01:04:22,444 --> 01:04:23,570
Come on in. Close the door.

997
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:29,743
Wow. Can I just say, sir...

998
01:04:29,826 --> 01:04:30,952
Yep.

999
01:04:31,745 --> 01:04:32,912
I am your biggest fan.

1000
01:04:33,079 --> 01:04:35,199
First, is this your van?
Is anyone else gonna come in?

1001
01:04:35,248 --> 01:04:36,291
No, no, no. Just us.

1002
01:04:36,374 --> 01:04:37,459
Great. What's your name?

1003
01:04:37,542 --> 01:04:39,127
- 680'-
- 680'-

1004
01:04:40,670 --> 01:04:42,255
- Wow.
- Right there is fine.

1005
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,548
- Okay.
- Okay?

1006
01:04:43,631 --> 01:04:44,871
I get a lot of this, it's okay.

1007
01:04:45,175 --> 01:04:47,177
- Good. Can I just say?
- What do you want? Yeah.

1008
01:04:47,969 --> 01:04:50,680
I don't know if you can tell,

1009
01:04:50,764 --> 01:04:52,891
but I have patterned
my whole look after you.

1010
01:04:52,974 --> 01:04:54,374
- My hair's a little...
- It's fine.

1011
01:04:54,434 --> 01:04:55,977
It's not right,
'cause there's no product in it.

1012
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:57,854
Right.

1013
01:04:58,104 --> 01:05:01,983
I don't want to make things awkward
for you, but I do have to show you...

1014
01:05:02,233 --> 01:05:03,443
Boom!

1015
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:06,654
A Hispanic Scott Baio.

1016
01:05:06,738 --> 01:05:09,449
- I'm sorry. Ls that me?
- Yeah. It's... I mean...

1017
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:14,287
I had them do it off a doll that I made,
so it's not like it's off a picture.

1018
01:05:14,871 --> 01:05:17,832
- So it's a little bit...
- Gary. Listen to me, okay?

1019
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:21,836
I don't want to clip your wings, here.
We're both a little over-excited.

1020
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,838
I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys.

1021
01:05:23,922 --> 01:05:26,683
I'm trying to grab a little something
from some hard-crypt data files.

1022
01:05:26,716 --> 01:05:27,842
I don't have enough juice.

1023
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:30,261
I need you to jump on the roof...
Right?

1024
01:05:30,345 --> 01:05:32,555
Recalibrate the ISDNs.

1025
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:34,682
Pump it up by about 40%.

1026
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,267
- Got it.
- All right? It's a mission.

1027
01:05:36,351 --> 01:05:37,352
Yeah.

1028
01:05:37,435 --> 01:05:39,437
Tony needs Gary.

1029
01:05:39,521 --> 01:05:40,688
And Gary needs Tony.

1030
01:05:40,772 --> 01:05:42,107
- Be quiet about it. Go.
- Yeah.

1031
01:06:05,463 --> 01:06:09,175
<i>What would you regard
as the defining moment of your life?</i>

1032
01:06:09,384 --> 01:06:12,137
<i>I think that would be the day
I decided not to let my injury beat me.</i>

1033
01:06:14,806 --> 01:06:16,474
<i>Will you please state your name
for the camera?</i>

1034
01:06:16,558 --> 01:06:17,809
<i>Ellen Brandt.</i>

1035
01:06:18,226 --> 01:06:22,230
<i>Okay. So, the injections
are administered periodically.</i>

1036
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,760
<i>Addiction will not be tolerated.</i>

1037
01:06:23,815 --> 01:06:26,776
<i>Those who cannot regulate
will be out from the programme.</i>

1038
01:06:28,153 --> 01:06:30,989
<i>Once misfits, cripples...</i>

1039
01:06:31,656 --> 01:06:34,742
<i>You are the next iteration
of human evolution.</i>

1040
01:06:39,414 --> 01:06:40,915
<i>Everybody, before we start...</i>

1041
01:06:41,166 --> 01:06:44,210
<i>I promise you, looking back at your life,
there will be nothing as bitter</i>

1042
01:06:44,294 --> 01:06:48,423
<i>as the memory of that glorious risk
you prudently elected to forego.</i>

1043
01:06:48,506 --> 01:06:50,175
<i>Today is your glory</i>

1044
01:06:50,258 --> 01:06:51,342
<i>Let's begin.</i>

1045
01:07:02,645 --> 01:07:03,938
<i>We gotta get out of here!
We gotta get out of here!</i>

1046
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,425
<i>Get her out!
Get them out of here!</i>

1047
01:07:12,447 --> 01:07:15,283
A bomb is not a bomb
when it's a misfire.

1048
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:19,996
The stuff doesn't always work.
Right, pal?

1049
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,290
It's faulty,
but you found a buyer, didn't you?

1050
01:07:22,373 --> 01:07:24,709
Sold it to the Mandarin.

1051
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:27,545
Got you, pal.

1052
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:31,633
<i>What happened?</i>

1053
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:34,302
Fun fact.

1054
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:37,513
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,

1055
01:07:38,014 --> 01:07:42,018
the idealistic Wernher von Braun

1056
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,312
dreamed of space travel.

1057
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:47,440
He stargazed.

1058
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:51,277
Do you know what he said
when the first V-2 hit London?

1059
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:55,740
"The rocket performed perfectly."

1060
01:07:57,659 --> 01:08:00,328
"It just landed on the wrong planet."

1061
01:08:01,204 --> 01:08:06,000
See, we all begin wide-eyed.
Pure science.

1062
01:08:06,626 --> 01:08:11,631
And then the ego steps in,
the obsession.

1063
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:14,968
And you look up,

1064
01:08:16,928 --> 01:08:19,305
you're a long way from shore.

1065
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:22,392
You can't be too hard on yourself,
Maya.

1066
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:25,561
I mean, you gave your research
to a think tank.

1067
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:29,190
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank
on military contracts.

1068
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:31,818
That's exactly what we used to do.

1069
01:08:32,068 --> 01:08:34,112
So, don't judge yourself.

1070
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:37,615
Thank you, Pepper.

1071
01:08:38,825 --> 01:08:40,618
I really appreciate that.

1072
01:08:48,293 --> 01:08:50,586
- Hi, good evening. Come on in.
- Good evening.

1073
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,756
<i>Maya, rum!</i>

1074
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:57,593
Hi, Pepper.

1075
01:08:59,262 --> 01:09:01,389
So, you want to tell me why you
were at Stark's mansion last night?

1076
01:09:01,806 --> 01:09:02,807
I'm trying to fix this thing.

1077
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,184
I didn't know you and the master
were gonna blow the place up.

1078
01:09:05,268 --> 01:09:08,646
I see. So, you were trying
to save Stark, when he threatened us?

1079
01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:10,606
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

1080
01:09:12,692 --> 01:09:14,694
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

1081
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:17,739
Look, if we want to launch product
next year, I need Stark.

1082
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:21,367
He just lacked a decent incentive.
Now, he has one.

1083
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:27,915
<i>This is support team Blue-Zero.</i>

1084
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:30,668
<i>Sending coordinates for a suspected
Mandarin broadcast point of origin.</i>

1085
01:09:30,752 --> 01:09:31,794
COPY-

1086
01:09:39,927 --> 01:09:41,095
Nobody move.

1087
01:09:46,184 --> 01:09:47,268
Support Blue-Zero,

1088
01:09:47,435 --> 01:09:49,270
unless the Mandarin's next attack
on the U.S.

1089
01:09:49,354 --> 01:09:50,938
involves cheaply-made sportswear,

1090
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,441
I think you messed up again.

1091
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:56,361
Yes, you're free, if you weren't before.

1092
01:09:56,652 --> 01:09:57,695
It's... Of course.

1093
01:09:57,779 --> 01:09:58,780
Yes, ma'am.

1094
01:09:58,946 --> 01:09:59,989
Iron Patriot on the job.

1095
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:01,157
Happy to help.

1096
01:10:01,366 --> 01:10:02,450
No need to thank me, ma'am.

1097
01:10:02,617 --> 01:10:03,826
It's my pleasure.

1098
01:10:11,959 --> 01:10:14,212
Savin?
I've acquired the Patriot armour.

1099
01:10:14,295 --> 01:10:15,546
If you want this suit,

1100
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:17,965
you're going to have to
pry my cold dead body out of it.

1101
01:10:18,299 --> 01:10:19,759
That's the plan, Colonel.

1102
01:10:21,344 --> 01:10:23,930
Harley, tell me what's happening.
Give me a full report.

1103
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:27,308
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy.
Do you want me to keep eating it?

1104
01:10:27,642 --> 01:10:29,442
- How much have you had?
- Two or three bowls.

1105
01:10:29,519 --> 01:10:32,313
<i>- Can you still see straight?
- Sort of.</i>

1106
01:10:32,397 --> 01:10:33,917
That means you're fine.
Give me Jarvis.

1107
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:35,400
<i>Jarvis, how are we?</i>

1108
01:10:35,483 --> 01:10:37,735
<i>It's totally fine, sir.
I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</i>

1109
01:10:37,819 --> 01:10:40,863
<i>and then at the end of the sentence,
I say the wrong cranberry.</i>

1110
01:10:40,947 --> 01:10:42,240
<i>And, sir, you were right.</i>

1111
01:10:42,323 --> 01:10:44,992
<i>Once I factored in
available AIM downlink facilities</i>

1112
01:10:45,326 --> 01:10:47,495
<i>I was able to pinpoint
the Mandarin's broadcast signal.</i>

1113
01:10:47,829 --> 01:10:49,949
What are we talking?
Far East, Europe, North Africa...

1114
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:51,958
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

1115
01:10:52,166 --> 01:10:53,459
<i>Actually, sir, it's in Miami.</i>

1116
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:56,421
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have
to walk you through

1117
01:10:56,504 --> 01:10:57,880
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,

1118
01:10:57,964 --> 01:10:59,382
but not right now.

1119
01:10:59,465 --> 01:11:00,545
Harley, where is he really?

1120
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:02,596
<i>Just look on the screen
and tell me where it is.</i>

1121
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:06,222
It does say Miami, Florida.

1122
01:11:06,305 --> 01:11:09,267
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?

1123
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:10,768
It's not charging.

1124
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:21,320
<i>Actually, sir, it is charging,
but the power source is questionable.</i>

1125
01:11:21,529 --> 01:11:23,823
<i>It may not succeed
in revitalising the Mark 42.</i>

1126
01:11:24,031 --> 01:11:25,825
What's questionable about electricity?
All right?

1127
01:11:25,908 --> 01:11:29,787
It's my suit, and I can't...
I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...

1128
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:31,831
Oh, God, not again.

1129
01:11:32,039 --> 01:11:33,624
<i>Tony?</i>

1130
01:11:35,751 --> 01:11:37,587
<i>Are you having another attack?</i>

1131
01:11:37,753 --> 01:11:38,993
I didn't even mention New York.

1132
01:11:39,046 --> 01:11:42,508
Right, and then you just said it by name
while denying having said it.

1133
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:44,385
Okay...

1134
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:47,680
God, what am I gonna do?

1135
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:51,309
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.

1136
01:11:51,809 --> 01:11:54,228
You're a mechanic, right?

1137
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,771
Right.

1138
01:11:56,564 --> 01:11:57,940
<i>You said so.</i>

1139
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:00,401
Yes, I did.

1140
01:12:00,735 --> 01:12:03,404
Why don't you just build something?

1141
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:16,459
Okay.

1142
01:12:17,502 --> 01:12:18,503
<i>Thanks, kid.</i>

1143
01:14:02,273 --> 01:14:07,278
Why is it so hot in here?
I told you to put it at 68.

1144
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,696
My fault again.

1145
01:14:08,779 --> 01:14:11,619
Let me tell you something, sweetheart.
I am not your personal air con...

1146
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:12,968
Well.

1147
01:15:14,512 --> 01:15:16,806
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.

1148
01:15:18,057 --> 01:15:20,393
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

1149
01:15:20,476 --> 01:15:21,769
That's me.

1150
01:15:22,353 --> 01:15:23,396
Nessie.

1151
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:28,567
Did you know that fortune cookies
aren't even Chinese?

1152
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:30,152
There's some guy over here.

1153
01:15:30,236 --> 01:15:33,447
They're made by Americans,
based on a Japanese recipe.

1154
01:15:33,698 --> 01:15:34,740
Hey!

1155
01:15:36,826 --> 01:15:37,868
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1156
01:15:38,452 --> 01:15:39,495
Don't move.

1157
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:41,706
I'm not moving.
You want something? Take it.

1158
01:15:41,789 --> 01:15:42,790
Although the guns are all fake

1159
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,709
because those wankers
wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

1160
01:15:44,792 --> 01:15:47,044
- What?
- Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

1161
01:15:49,046 --> 01:15:50,297
Heard enough.

1162
01:15:50,381 --> 01:15:52,466
You're not him.
The Mandarin, the real guy.

1163
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:53,676
Where?

1164
01:15:53,759 --> 01:15:55,928
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

1165
01:15:56,429 --> 01:15:58,973
He's here.
He's here, but he's not here.

1166
01:15:59,056 --> 01:16:01,056
- He's here, but he's not here.
- What do you mean?

1167
01:16:01,058 --> 01:16:02,810
It's complicated.
Hey, it's complicated.

1168
01:16:03,102 --> 01:16:04,645
- It is.
- It's complicated.

1169
01:16:04,854 --> 01:16:06,063
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.

1170
01:16:06,147 --> 01:16:07,787
Get out of the bed.
Get into the bathroom.

1171
01:16:10,443 --> 01:16:11,652
Sit.

1172
01:16:12,653 --> 01:16:13,779
Oh, Jesus.

1173
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:23,956
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1174
01:16:24,039 --> 01:16:25,082
What are you?

1175
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,793
A decoy? You're a double, right?

1176
01:16:28,085 --> 01:16:30,963
You mean like an understudy?
No, absolutely not.

1177
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:33,841
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

1178
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,719
You got a minute to live.
Fill it with words.

1179
01:16:36,802 --> 01:16:40,765
It's just a role.
"The Mandarin," it's not real.

1180
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,225
Then how did you get here, Trevor?

1181
01:16:45,186 --> 01:16:51,358
Well, I had a little problem
with substances.

1182
01:16:51,442 --> 01:16:55,696
And I ended up doing things,
no two ways about it,

1183
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:58,073
in the street,
that a man shouldn't do.

1184
01:16:58,240 --> 01:16:59,700
- Next?
- Then,

1185
01:16:59,784 --> 01:17:02,661
they approached me
about the role,

1186
01:17:02,745 --> 01:17:04,163
and they knew about the drugs.

1187
01:17:04,246 --> 01:17:05,414
What did they say?
They'd get you off them?

1188
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:07,208
They said they'd give me more.

1189
01:17:07,291 --> 01:17:08,334
They gave me things.

1190
01:17:08,417 --> 01:17:11,921
They gave me this palace.
They gave me plastic surgery.

1191
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:14,256
They gave me things.

1192
01:17:15,424 --> 01:17:16,550
Did you just nod off?

1193
01:17:16,717 --> 01:17:17,718
Hey.

1194
01:17:17,802 --> 01:17:19,637
No, and a lovely speedboat.

1195
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,139
And the thing was, he needed someone

1196
01:17:22,223 --> 01:17:26,143
to take credit
for some accidental explosions.

1197
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:30,564
"He"?

1198
01:17:33,192 --> 01:17:35,152
- Killian?
- Killian.

1199
01:17:35,236 --> 01:17:38,072
- He created you?
- He created me.

1200
01:17:38,781 --> 01:17:39,821
Custom-made terror threat.

1201
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:42,076
Yes. Yes.

1202
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:44,036
His think tank thinked it up.

1203
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,747
The pathology of a serial killer.

1204
01:17:46,956 --> 01:17:49,834
The manipulation
of Western iconography.

1205
01:17:50,334 --> 01:17:53,420
Ready for another lesson?

1206
01:17:53,671 --> 01:17:54,964
Blah, blah, blah.

1207
01:17:55,256 --> 01:17:56,507
No.

1208
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,552
Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.

1209
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:01,178
Your performance?

1210
01:18:02,221 --> 01:18:03,221
Where people died?

1211
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:04,974
No, they didn't.

1212
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:08,978
Look around you.
The costumes, green screen.

1213
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:11,188
Honestly,
I wasn't on location for half this stuff.

1214
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:13,065
And when I was,
it was movie magic, love.

1215
01:18:13,357 --> 01:18:15,317
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend
who's in a coma

1216
01:18:15,401 --> 01:18:16,569
and he might not wake up.

1217
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:17,987
So you're gonna have
to answer for that.

1218
01:18:18,070 --> 01:18:19,572
You're still going down, pal.

1219
01:18:19,655 --> 01:18:20,656
You under...

1220
01:18:27,246 --> 01:18:30,249
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

1221
01:18:30,583 --> 01:18:32,835
- I didn't tell him anything.
- Nothing?

1222
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:34,837
No.

1223
01:18:35,129 --> 01:18:36,729
You should have pressed
the panic button.

1224
01:18:37,298 --> 01:18:39,633
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

1225
01:18:52,313 --> 01:18:53,397
Okay.

1226
01:19:02,364 --> 01:19:03,991
It's just like old times, huh?

1227
01:19:04,366 --> 01:19:07,077
Yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

1228
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:08,787
It wasn't my idea.

1229
01:19:08,871 --> 01:19:10,873
Okay. So you took Killian's card.

1230
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:12,041
I took his money.

1231
01:19:12,333 --> 01:19:14,501
And here you are 13 years later,
in a dungeon.

1232
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:16,420
- No.
- Yeah.

1233
01:19:16,503 --> 01:19:18,172
No, you're in a dungeon.
I'm free to go.

1234
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,090
Yeah?

1235
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:25,471
A lot has happened, Tony.

1236
01:19:26,430 --> 01:19:27,890
But I'm close.

1237
01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:30,684
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.

1238
01:19:30,768 --> 01:19:32,937
I'm telling you it isn't.
I'm on the street.

1239
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:34,438
People are going bang.
They're painting the walls.

1240
01:19:34,521 --> 01:19:35,856
Maya, you're kidding yourself.

1241
01:19:35,940 --> 01:19:37,191
Then help me fix it.

1242
01:19:42,571 --> 01:19:43,864
Did I do that?

1243
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:46,200
Yes.

1244
01:19:46,533 --> 01:19:48,053
I remember the night, not the morning.

1245
01:19:48,911 --> 01:19:50,204
Is this what
you've been chasing around?

1246
01:19:50,287 --> 01:19:52,373
- You don't remember?
- I can't help you.

1247
01:19:53,374 --> 01:19:56,961
You used to have a moral psychology.

1248
01:19:57,044 --> 01:19:59,213
You used to have ideals.

1249
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:01,966
You wanted to help people.

1250
01:20:02,049 --> 01:20:03,926
Now look at you.

1251
01:20:04,969 --> 01:20:06,929
I get to wake up every morning
with someone who

1252
01:20:10,224 --> 01:20:11,767
still has their soul.

1253
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:18,440
Get me out of here.

1254
01:20:21,443 --> 01:20:22,903
Come on.

1255
01:20:24,071 --> 01:20:25,751
You know what my old man
used to say to me?

1256
01:20:26,782 --> 01:20:29,868
One of his favourite of many sayings...

1257
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:34,331
"The early bird gets the worm,
but the second mouse gets the cheese."

1258
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:36,667
You're not still pissed off
about the Switzerland thing, are you?

1259
01:20:36,750 --> 01:20:39,169
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?

1260
01:20:39,253 --> 01:20:41,255
I'm here to thank you.

1261
01:20:41,422 --> 01:20:43,742
You gave me the greatest gift
that anybody's ever given me.

1262
01:20:44,425 --> 01:20:45,884
Desperation.

1263
01:20:46,427 --> 01:20:48,095
If you think back to Switzerland,

1264
01:20:48,220 --> 01:20:51,181
you said you'd meet me
on the rooftop, right?

1265
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:54,143
For the first 20 minutes,

1266
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:56,562
I actually thought you'd show up.

1267
01:20:56,645 --> 01:20:58,439
And the next hour...

1268
01:21:00,024 --> 01:21:04,445
I considered taking
that one-step shortcut to the lobby.

1269
01:21:04,737 --> 01:21:05,738
If you know what I mean.

1270
01:21:06,113 --> 01:21:09,116
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out
what happened to the first mouse.

1271
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,869
But as I looked out over that city,

1272
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:14,788
<i>nobody knew I was there,
nobody could see me,</i>

1273
01:21:14,872 --> 01:21:17,124
<i>no one was even looking.</i>

1274
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:21,211
<i>I had a thought that would guide me
for years to come.</i>

1275
01:21:21,795 --> 01:21:23,005
Anonymity, Tony.

1276
01:21:24,673 --> 01:21:26,473
Thanks to you,
it's been my mantra ever since.

1277
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,634
Right?

1278
01:21:27,718 --> 01:21:30,137
You simply rule
from behind the scenes.

1279
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:32,681
<i>Because the second
you give evil a face,</i>

1280
01:21:32,890 --> 01:21:35,726
<i>a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,</i>

1281
01:21:35,809 --> 01:21:37,394
you hand the people a target.

1282
01:21:37,686 --> 01:21:39,146
You're something else.

1283
01:21:41,398 --> 01:21:42,483
You have met him, I assume?

1284
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:44,151
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

1285
01:21:44,234 --> 01:21:46,570
I know he's a little
over the top sometimes.

1286
01:21:46,653 --> 01:21:48,363
It's not entirely my fault.
He has a tenden...

1287
01:21:48,447 --> 01:21:49,490
He's a stage actor.

1288
01:21:50,491 --> 01:21:53,577
They say his Lear was
the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.

1289
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:55,704
Anyway, the point is,

1290
01:21:55,788 --> 01:21:59,124
ever since that big dude
with the hammer fell out of the sky,

1291
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,528
subtlety has kind of had its day.

1292
01:22:01,168 --> 01:22:02,753
What's next for you in your world?

1293
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:07,966
I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.

1294
01:22:14,765 --> 01:22:15,766
Desperation.

1295
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:17,768
Now, this is live.

1296
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,063
I'm not sure if you can tell,
but at this moment

1297
01:22:21,146 --> 01:22:25,609
the body is trying to decide whether to
accept EXTREMIS, or just give up.

1298
01:22:25,818 --> 01:22:27,528
And if it gives up,

1299
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,533
I have to say,
the detonation is quite spectacular.

1300
01:22:33,492 --> 01:22:36,912
But until that point,
it's really just a lot of pain.

1301
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:41,625
We haven't even talked salary yet.

1302
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:44,211
What kind of perk package
are you thinking of?

1303
01:22:45,087 --> 01:22:46,088
Let him go.

1304
01:22:47,381 --> 01:22:48,382
Hold on, hold on.

1305
01:22:49,341 --> 01:22:50,384
Maya...

1306
01:22:50,592 --> 01:22:52,427
I said, let him go.

1307
01:22:53,178 --> 01:22:54,596
What are you doing?

1308
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:57,391
1200 CCs.
A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

1309
01:22:58,267 --> 01:23:02,479
It's times like this my temper
is tested somewhat.

1310
01:23:02,563 --> 01:23:03,897
Maya, give me the injector.

1311
01:23:03,981 --> 01:23:06,441
If I die, Killian,

1312
01:23:06,525 --> 01:23:09,611
what happens to your soldiers?
What happens to your product?

1313
01:23:09,695 --> 01:23:10,904
We're not doing this, okay?

1314
01:23:11,113 --> 01:23:14,324
What happens to you?
What happens if you go too hot?

1315
01:23:26,253 --> 01:23:27,296
The good news is,

1316
01:23:28,630 --> 01:23:30,883
a high-level position
has just been vacated.

1317
01:23:40,267 --> 01:23:41,560
You are a maniac.

1318
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:43,812
No, I'm a visionary.

1319
01:23:44,146 --> 01:23:46,356
But I do own a maniac.

1320
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:49,401
And he takes the stage tonight.

1321
01:23:53,113 --> 01:23:54,198
Once we get the Patriot installed,

1322
01:23:54,281 --> 01:23:57,242
it will take me
nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

1323
01:23:57,326 --> 01:24:00,246
That's great, but the last time I looked,
there was somebody inside of it.

1324
01:24:06,168 --> 01:24:07,419
Afternoon, gentlemen.

1325
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:12,591
Hello, Colonel.

1326
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,927
Step aside.

1327
01:24:23,352 --> 01:24:25,103
We'll get you out of there.

1328
01:24:25,187 --> 01:24:26,313
Don't worry.

1329
01:24:27,022 --> 01:24:28,774
You'll damage the armour.

1330
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:30,400
Yes, I will.

1331
01:24:30,984 --> 01:24:32,152
But you can fix it, right?

1332
01:24:33,612 --> 01:24:35,739
I'm gonna take the Chinook
to base camp.

1333
01:24:35,822 --> 01:24:37,324
And I want Potts with me.

1334
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:38,408
She's still in Phase Two.

1335
01:24:40,452 --> 01:24:41,692
You're not going deaf, are you?

1336
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:00,681
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.

1337
01:25:01,098 --> 01:25:02,140
Hey, Ponytail Express.

1338
01:25:03,475 --> 01:25:05,310
What's the mileage count
between Tennessee and Miami?

1339
01:25:05,519 --> 01:25:06,520
832 miles.

1340
01:25:06,812 --> 01:25:08,105
Very nice.

1341
01:25:08,188 --> 01:25:09,523
I'm good like that.

1342
01:25:10,148 --> 01:25:11,608
Can you stop that?

1343
01:25:11,775 --> 01:25:13,235
Break it, you bought it.

1344
01:25:15,612 --> 01:25:16,613
I think I bought it.

1345
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:19,157
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away.
That belongs to my friend's sister.

1346
01:25:19,241 --> 01:25:21,660
And that's why
I'm gonna kill you first.

1347
01:25:22,577 --> 01:25:23,829
- What are you gonna do to me?
- You'll see.

1348
01:25:24,079 --> 01:25:25,539
You're zip-tied to a bed.

1349
01:25:26,373 --> 01:25:27,874
This.

1350
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:31,962
That.

1351
01:25:36,717 --> 01:25:38,343
Are you coming out?

1352
01:25:41,096 --> 01:25:43,390
Do not open. Do not open.
Don't open. Don't open.

1353
01:25:43,473 --> 01:25:44,474
All right. Let's go.

1354
01:25:52,566 --> 01:25:54,860
You... You breathe fire? Okay.

1355
01:25:59,406 --> 01:26:02,117
It's a glorious day, Savin.

1356
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,161
This time tomorrow,

1357
01:26:04,244 --> 01:26:07,831
I'll have the West's
most powerful leader in one hand,

1358
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:11,668
and the world's most feared terrorist
in the other.

1359
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:14,921
I'll own the war on terror.

1360
01:26:15,547 --> 01:26:16,965
Create supply and demand.

1361
01:26:17,549 --> 01:26:21,386
For you, for your brothers and sisters.

1362
01:26:23,638 --> 01:26:25,682
Trust me,
you're gonna be in a puddle of blood

1363
01:26:25,766 --> 01:26:28,185
on the ground in five, four, three...

1364
01:26:28,268 --> 01:26:29,561
Come on! Two...

1365
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,606
How did we get this shift?

1366
01:26:32,773 --> 01:26:34,149
All right,
I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.

1367
01:26:34,608 --> 01:26:36,026
Put down your weapons.

1368
01:26:36,109 --> 01:26:38,487
Tie yourselves to those chairs.
I'll let you live.

1369
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,947
In five, four, bang!

1370
01:26:41,114 --> 01:26:42,115
Wow.

1371
01:26:42,324 --> 01:26:44,034
You should be gone by now.
You should've already been gone.

1372
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:45,660
I am just beyond terrified.

1373
01:26:45,827 --> 01:26:47,245
Here it comes.

1374
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:49,664
- Three, four...
- Shut up.

1375
01:26:49,998 --> 01:26:51,500
Five, four, three, two, one!

1376
01:26:52,501 --> 01:26:54,002
Told you.

1377
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:06,723
Where's the rest?

1378
01:28:05,866 --> 01:28:08,577
Honestly,
I hate working here. They are so weird.

1379
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:16,334
Better late than never.

1380
01:28:22,048 --> 01:28:24,259
Not this time. Not the face.

1381
01:28:25,719 --> 01:28:27,637
It's good to be back.
Hello, by the way.

1382
01:28:27,721 --> 01:28:29,055
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

1383
01:28:34,269 --> 01:28:36,646
<i>All personnel, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1384
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:39,608
<i>Repeat, Stark is loose
and somewhere in the compound.</i>

1385
01:28:39,691 --> 01:28:40,901
Let's go!

1386
01:28:41,318 --> 01:28:42,569
Crap.

1387
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:56,374
Tony?

1388
01:28:56,583 --> 01:28:57,751
Rhodey, tell me
that was you in the suit.

1389
01:28:57,918 --> 01:28:59,920
No. You got yours?

1390
01:29:00,253 --> 01:29:02,130
Kind of.
Main house, as fast as you can.

1391
01:29:02,506 --> 01:29:04,026
<i>There's somebody I'd like you to meet.</i>

1392
01:29:08,929 --> 01:29:11,556
You, you, you! Move! Get out!

1393
01:29:11,765 --> 01:29:14,142
The room is secure.
I have eyes on the Mandarin.

1394
01:29:14,226 --> 01:29:15,435
What's this? I had winners.

1395
01:29:23,652 --> 01:29:24,778
What have you come as?

1396
01:29:25,111 --> 01:29:27,280
You make a move,
and I break your face.

1397
01:29:28,740 --> 01:29:32,244
I never thought people had been hurt.
They lied to me.

1398
01:29:32,661 --> 01:29:33,703
This is the Mandarin?

1399
01:29:33,870 --> 01:29:35,789
Yeah, I know, it's...
It's embarrassing.

1400
01:29:36,081 --> 01:29:37,666
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1401
01:29:37,999 --> 01:29:40,877
I know I'm shorter in person.
A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1402
01:29:40,961 --> 01:29:44,714
But, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.

1403
01:29:44,798 --> 01:29:46,258
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

1404
01:29:46,341 --> 01:29:48,468
You tell him where Pepper is
and he'll stop doing it.

1405
01:29:48,635 --> 01:29:50,095
Doing what?

1406
01:29:50,178 --> 01:29:52,347
I get it! That hurt. I get it! I get it!

1407
01:29:52,889 --> 01:29:56,142
I don't know about any Pepper,
but I know about the plan.

1408
01:29:56,434 --> 01:29:58,395
- Spill.
- Do you know what they did to my suit?

1409
01:29:58,478 --> 01:29:59,521
What? No.

1410
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:02,065
But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1411
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:05,569
Something to do with a big boat.

1412
01:30:05,652 --> 01:30:06,987
I can take you there.

1413
01:30:07,654 --> 01:30:09,531
<i>Ole', ole', ole', ole'...</i>

1414
01:30:09,614 --> 01:30:12,617
Tony, I swear to God,
I'm gonna blow his face off.

1415
01:30:12,701 --> 01:30:16,663
And this next bit may include
the vice president as well.

1416
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:18,490
Is that... ls that important?

1417
01:30:18,665 --> 01:30:20,292
- Somewhat.
- Yeah, a little bit.

1418
01:30:23,128 --> 01:30:24,129
So?

1419
01:30:24,671 --> 01:30:26,047
What are we gonna do?

1420
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:27,251
We don't have any transport.

1421
01:30:27,299 --> 01:30:28,300
Right.

1422
01:30:30,176 --> 01:30:31,303
Hey, Ringo.

1423
01:30:31,386 --> 01:30:34,014
Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1424
01:30:36,224 --> 01:30:38,727
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1425
01:30:38,893 --> 01:30:39,936
But we also have to figure out

1426
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:41,771
- this vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1427
01:30:41,855 --> 01:30:43,064
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1428
01:30:43,148 --> 01:30:44,188
That's the vice president.

1429
01:30:44,399 --> 01:30:45,692
Thanks.

1430
01:30:46,318 --> 01:30:47,444
Hello?

1431
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,195
<i>Sir, this is Tony Stark.</i>

1432
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,156
Welcome back to the land of the living.

1433
01:30:51,323 --> 01:30:53,491
We believe you're about to be drawn
into the Mandarin campaign.

1434
01:30:53,575 --> 01:30:55,160
We gotta get you somewhere safe
as soon as possible.

1435
01:30:55,535 --> 01:30:57,912
Mr Stark, I'm about
to eat honey-roast ham,

1436
01:30:57,996 --> 01:31:00,248
surrounded by the Agency's finest.

1437
01:31:00,332 --> 01:31:03,627
The president's safe on Air Force One
with Colonel Rhodes.

1438
01:31:03,710 --> 01:31:04,753
I think we're good, here.

1439
01:31:04,836 --> 01:31:06,838
<i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1440
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:09,133
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

1441
01:31:09,215 --> 01:31:10,550
<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1442
01:31:10,842 --> 01:31:12,402
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1443
01:31:12,552 --> 01:31:14,596
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1444
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,599
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1445
01:31:17,766 --> 01:31:19,446
<i>Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodes and Stark out.</i>

1446
01:31:21,102 --> 01:31:22,812
Everything okay, sir?

1447
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:24,898
Couldn't be better.

1448
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,239
I love you, babe.

1449
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:55,345
Colonel Rhodes.

1450
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:58,765
Glad to see you could make it, son.
I feel safer already.

1451
01:32:03,603 --> 01:32:04,729
We gotta make a decision.

1452
01:32:04,813 --> 01:32:07,607
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

1453
01:32:07,774 --> 01:32:09,401
<i>Sir, I have an update from Malibu.</i>

1454
01:32:09,484 --> 01:32:11,611
<i>The cranes have finally arrived,</i>

1455
01:32:11,778 --> 01:32:13,778
<i>and the cellar doors
are being cleared as we speak.</i>

1456
01:32:13,822 --> 01:32:15,532
And what about the suit I'm wearing?

1457
01:32:15,699 --> 01:32:17,951
<i>The armour is now at 92%.</i>

1458
01:32:18,034 --> 01:32:20,120
That's going to have to do.

1459
01:32:28,962 --> 01:32:30,255
Here he comes. Here he comes.
Get a quick picture.

1460
01:32:30,338 --> 01:32:31,381
Sure.

1461
01:32:48,690 --> 01:32:49,890
Everything all right, Colonel?

1462
01:33:22,682 --> 01:33:24,726
It is an honour, Mr President.

1463
01:33:25,101 --> 01:33:27,103
If you're gonna do it, do it!

1464
01:33:27,687 --> 01:33:29,439
Cool your boots, sir.

1465
01:33:29,522 --> 01:33:31,024
That's not how the Mandarin works.

1466
01:33:31,191 --> 01:33:33,610
Sir, Air Force One
has been compromised.

1467
01:33:33,693 --> 01:33:35,612
Internal shots, temperature spikes.

1468
01:33:35,695 --> 01:33:36,863
Get me eyes on it now.

1469
01:33:37,238 --> 01:33:39,157
Image coming through now, sir.

1470
01:33:41,576 --> 01:33:43,369
Was that Rhodes?

1471
01:33:52,504 --> 01:33:53,880
Is anyone there?

1472
01:33:54,214 --> 01:33:55,882
Let us out!

1473
01:34:12,357 --> 01:34:13,858
The President.

1474
01:34:14,359 --> 01:34:15,568
Now.

1475
01:34:15,652 --> 01:34:16,653
He's not here.

1476
01:34:20,782 --> 01:34:22,534
Try the jet stream?

1477
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:25,578
Speaking of which, go fish.

1478
01:34:48,309 --> 01:34:50,270
Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.

1479
01:35:03,283 --> 01:35:04,284
How many in the air?

1480
01:35:04,951 --> 01:35:05,994
<i>Thirteen, sir.</i>

1481
01:35:07,912 --> 01:35:09,914
- How many can I carry?
- Four, sir.

1482
01:35:19,340 --> 01:35:22,927
Slow down. Slow down, relax.
What's your name? Heather?

1483
01:35:28,057 --> 01:35:30,602
Oh, God! No! No!

1484
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:33,438
Listen to me. See that guy?

1485
01:35:33,646 --> 01:35:35,486
I'm gonna swing by,
you're just gonna grab him.

1486
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,025
- You got it?
- What?

1487
01:35:39,569 --> 01:35:42,864
I'll electrify your arm,
you won't be able to open your hand.

1488
01:35:44,115 --> 01:35:45,325
We can do this, Heather.

1489
01:35:54,208 --> 01:35:56,461
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.

1490
01:35:59,881 --> 01:36:01,925
Remember that game
called Barrel of Monkeys?

1491
01:36:02,008 --> 01:36:03,092
That's what we're going to do.

1492
01:36:03,176 --> 01:36:04,427
<i>18,000 feet.</i>

1493
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:06,270
Come on, people.
Everybody, grab your monkey.

1494
01:36:10,975 --> 01:36:12,226
Nice.

1495
01:36:12,602 --> 01:36:14,228
<i>10,000 feet.</i>

1496
01:36:17,607 --> 01:36:18,858
<i>6,000 feet.</i>

1497
01:36:19,025 --> 01:36:20,568
Come on, people.

1498
01:36:21,527 --> 01:36:22,737
Come on, come on, come on!

1499
01:36:26,032 --> 01:36:27,158
Yeah!

1500
01:36:27,700 --> 01:36:29,077
<i>1,000 feet.</i>

1501
01:36:30,244 --> 01:36:31,829
<i>400 feet.</i>

1502
01:36:32,413 --> 01:36:33,623
<i>200 feet, sir.</i>

1503
01:36:33,706 --> 01:36:35,146
He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.

1504
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,043
Hello.

1505
01:36:58,398 --> 01:36:59,482
We made it!

1506
01:37:00,233 --> 01:37:01,693
Nice work, guys!

1507
01:37:01,776 --> 01:37:04,404
Excellent.
Good team effort all around. Go us.

1508
01:37:04,696 --> 01:37:05,780
All right, Jarvis.

1509
01:37:05,863 --> 01:37:08,103
But it's only half-done.
We've still got to get Pepper...

1510
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:16,874
That came out of nowhere.

1511
01:37:16,958 --> 01:37:18,167
Wow.

1512
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:19,711
Give me some good news, man.

1513
01:37:19,794 --> 01:37:20,795
I think they all made it.

1514
01:37:20,878 --> 01:37:21,878
Thank God.

1515
01:37:21,921 --> 01:37:23,241
Yeah, but I missed the president.

1516
01:37:23,423 --> 01:37:25,299
You couldn't save the president
with the suit,

1517
01:37:25,383 --> 01:37:27,510
how are we gonna save Pepper
with nothing?

1518
01:37:27,593 --> 01:37:29,637
Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

1519
01:37:29,721 --> 01:37:31,639
<i>The House Party Protocol, sir?</i>

1520
01:37:31,723 --> 01:37:32,765
Correct.

1521
01:38:03,129 --> 01:38:04,464
Hi.

1522
01:38:11,971 --> 01:38:14,307
You think he's gonna help you?

1523
01:38:14,974 --> 01:38:16,392
He won't.

1524
01:38:20,855 --> 01:38:24,776
Having you here is not
just to motivate Tony Stark. It's...

1525
01:38:25,234 --> 01:38:27,945
Well, it's actually
more embarrassing than that.

1526
01:38:28,029 --> 01:38:30,239
You're here as my...

1527
01:38:31,157 --> 01:38:32,992
trophy-

1528
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,547
Good evening, sir.

1529
01:38:51,177 --> 01:38:53,930
Welcome aboard, Mr President.

1530
01:39:02,438 --> 01:39:04,023
Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?

1531
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:08,903
Well, two years ago,
the elephant in the room was this scow.

1532
01:39:11,239 --> 01:39:12,365
<i>This is the Roxxon Norco.</i>

1533
01:39:12,615 --> 01:39:13,616
And, of course, you'll remember

1534
01:39:13,699 --> 01:39:16,369
that when she spilled a million gallons
of crude off Pensacola,

1535
01:39:16,619 --> 01:39:19,372
thanks to you,
not one fat cat saw a day in court.

1536
01:39:19,789 --> 01:39:21,541
What do you want from me?

1537
01:39:22,500 --> 01:39:23,751
Nothing, sir.

1538
01:39:24,127 --> 01:39:27,588
I just needed a reason to kill you
that would play well on TV.

1539
01:39:27,672 --> 01:39:29,715
You see, I've moved on.

1540
01:39:29,799 --> 01:39:32,176
I found myself a new political patron,

1541
01:39:32,593 --> 01:39:35,388
and this time tomorrow,
he'll have your job.

1542
01:39:36,389 --> 01:39:38,224
String him up.

1543
01:39:39,725 --> 01:39:40,893
Hey!

1544
01:39:56,993 --> 01:39:58,619
Come on.

1545
01:40:02,123 --> 01:40:04,041
You're not gonna freak out on me,
right?

1546
01:40:04,125 --> 01:40:05,835
I hope not.

1547
01:40:30,484 --> 01:40:32,320
Oh, my God.

1548
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:36,073
He's strung up over the oil tanker.
They're gonna light him up, man.

1549
01:40:36,157 --> 01:40:38,743
Viking funeral.
Public execution.

1550
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:40,620
Yeah, death by oil.

1551
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:49,837
<i>Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.</i>

1552
01:40:51,297 --> 01:40:52,423
Okay. That's good.

1553
01:40:52,506 --> 01:40:56,344
Now give me cameras A through E
and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.

1554
01:40:57,511 --> 01:40:58,763
Is your gun UP?

1555
01:40:58,846 --> 01:41:00,431
Yep. What do I do?

1556
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:02,975
Stay on my six, cover high
and don't shoot me in the back.

1557
01:41:03,142 --> 01:41:05,311
Six, high, back. All right.

1558
01:41:14,237 --> 01:41:15,529
You see that? Nailed it.

1559
01:41:16,155 --> 01:41:17,515
Yeah, you really killed the glass.

1560
01:41:17,573 --> 01:41:18,658
You think I was aiming for the bulb?

1561
01:41:18,741 --> 01:41:20,261
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.

1562
01:41:21,452 --> 01:41:22,912
<i>All personnel, we have hostiles</i>

1563
01:41:22,995 --> 01:41:24,235
<i>- on east unit 12.
- Over there!</i>

1564
01:41:24,247 --> 01:41:25,831
<i>- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
- I'm out. Give</i> me...

1565
01:41:25,915 --> 01:41:28,209
- You got extra magazines?
- They're not universal, Tony.

1566
01:41:28,376 --> 01:41:30,419
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff.
Give me another one.

1567
01:41:30,503 --> 01:41:31,796
- One of yours.
- I don't have one that fits that gun.

1568
01:41:31,879 --> 01:41:32,964
You've got, like, five of them.

1569
01:41:33,047 --> 01:41:34,257
Here's what I'm going to do.

1570
01:41:34,423 --> 01:41:36,300
Save my spot, ready?

1571
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:39,178
- What'd you see?
- Too fast. Nothing.

1572
01:41:39,262 --> 01:41:40,554
Here we go.

1573
01:41:44,517 --> 01:41:46,352
Three guys, one girl, all armed.

1574
01:41:56,445 --> 01:41:57,989
God, I would kill
for some armour right now.

1575
01:41:58,072 --> 01:42:00,032
- You're right. We need backup.
- Yeah, a bunch.

1576
01:42:01,701 --> 01:42:02,827
You know what?

1577
01:42:06,789 --> 01:42:07,873
Is that...

1578
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:09,834
Yep.

1579
01:42:09,917 --> 01:42:11,544
- Are those...
- Yeah.

1580
01:42:28,227 --> 01:42:29,478
Merry Christmas, buddy.

1581
01:42:34,817 --> 01:42:37,486
Jarvis, target
EXTREMIS heat signatures.

1582
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:39,405
Disable with extreme prejudice.

1583
01:42:39,905 --> 01:42:40,906
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1584
01:42:44,910 --> 01:42:47,788
What are you waiting for?
It's Christmas.

1585
01:42:49,290 --> 01:42:50,333
Take them to church.

1586
01:42:57,423 --> 01:42:59,091
<i>Gentlemen.</i>

1587
01:43:06,349 --> 01:43:07,350
Incoming!

1588
01:43:11,979 --> 01:43:13,606
Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.

1589
01:43:26,619 --> 01:43:28,699
This is how you've been managing
your down time, huh?

1590
01:43:28,704 --> 01:43:29,789
Everybody needs a hobby.

1591
01:43:36,295 --> 01:43:38,055
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out,
will you?

1592
01:44:06,242 --> 01:44:07,827
Nice timing.

1593
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:10,121
Yeah. That's awesome.
Give me a suit, okay?

1594
01:44:11,497 --> 01:44:13,249
I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

1595
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:15,584
- What does that mean?
- I got you covered.

1596
01:44:18,879 --> 01:44:21,257
<i>Good evening, Colonel.
Can I give you a lift?</i>

1597
01:44:21,340 --> 01:44:22,800
Very funny.

1598
01:44:39,859 --> 01:44:41,152
<i>Sir, I've located Ms Potts.</i>

1599
01:44:41,235 --> 01:44:42,236
About time.

1600
01:44:55,249 --> 01:44:59,712
Stop!
Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

1601
01:45:00,754 --> 01:45:04,383
See what happens when you hang out
with my ex-girlfriends?

1602
01:45:05,551 --> 01:45:06,802
You're such a jerk.

1603
01:45:06,969 --> 01:45:08,449
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.

1604
01:45:10,806 --> 01:45:12,057
Come on. A little more, baby.

1605
01:45:28,574 --> 01:45:29,617
Is this guy bothering you?

1606
01:45:31,410 --> 01:45:32,786
Don't get up.

1607
01:45:37,416 --> 01:45:38,542
Is it hot in there?

1608
01:45:40,836 --> 01:45:42,196
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?

1609
01:45:43,297 --> 01:45:46,592
Like a little turtle,
cooking in his little turtle suit.

1610
01:45:46,926 --> 01:45:47,927
Tony.

1611
01:45:48,886 --> 01:45:50,012
She's watching.

1612
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:53,080
I think you should close your eyes.

1613
01:45:53,432 --> 01:45:54,934
Close your eyes.

1614
01:45:55,601 --> 01:45:57,770
Close your eyes.
You don't want to see this.

1615
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,904
Yeah, you take a minute.

1616
01:46:39,311 --> 01:46:41,564
Jarvis, give me a suit right now!

1617
01:46:52,575 --> 01:46:53,576
Come on!

1618
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:58,706
Mr President!
Just hold on, all right? I'm coming.

1619
01:46:59,623 --> 01:47:02,001
Just hold on. Hold on.

1620
01:47:14,888 --> 01:47:16,223
Okay.

1621
01:47:23,731 --> 01:47:25,024
Bye-bye.

1622
01:47:36,744 --> 01:47:37,911
Brace yourself.

1623
01:47:48,881 --> 01:47:50,758
You look damn good, Mr President,

1624
01:47:50,924 --> 01:47:52,384
but I'm gonna need that suit back.

1625
01:48:05,981 --> 01:48:07,181
<i>The President is secure, Tony.</i>

1626
01:48:07,191 --> 01:48:08,631
<i>- I'm clearing the area.</i>
- Nice work.

1627
01:48:09,652 --> 01:48:11,862
- Ready, sir?
- What do you mean "ready"?

1628
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:22,831
Pep, I got you.
Relax, I got you.

1629
01:48:22,915 --> 01:48:23,916
Just look at me!

1630
01:48:26,418 --> 01:48:28,699
Honey, I can't reach any further
and you can't stay there.

1631
01:48:28,754 --> 01:48:30,214
All right? You've got to let go.

1632
01:48:30,673 --> 01:48:33,759
You've got to let go!
I'll catch you, I promise.

1633
01:48:36,178 --> 01:48:37,179
No!

1634
01:49:03,956 --> 01:49:07,084
A shame. I would've caught her.

1635
01:49:38,157 --> 01:49:39,241
Eject.

1636
01:50:24,661 --> 01:50:26,246
Well, here we are on the roof.

1637
01:50:36,965 --> 01:50:38,050
<i>Mark 42, inbound.</i>

1638
01:50:38,217 --> 01:50:41,553
I'll be damned.
The prodigal son returns.

1639
01:50:57,528 --> 01:50:58,529
Whatever.

1640
01:50:59,738 --> 01:51:01,240
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.

1641
01:51:02,866 --> 01:51:06,620
It's a pity.
I was so close to having her perfect.

1642
01:51:09,414 --> 01:51:11,750
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait!
Slow down! Slow down!

1643
01:51:11,917 --> 01:51:14,211
You're right. I don't deserve her.

1644
01:51:15,587 --> 01:51:17,506
Here's where you're wrong.

1645
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:18,799
She was already perfect.

1646
01:51:26,598 --> 01:51:28,183
Jarvis,

1647
01:51:29,268 --> 01:51:30,769
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

1648
01:51:31,186 --> 01:51:32,271
No...

1649
01:52:46,219 --> 01:52:48,305
No more false faces.

1650
01:52:49,181 --> 01:52:50,974
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

1651
01:52:52,142 --> 01:52:54,853
You're looking right at him.

1652
01:52:55,187 --> 01:52:58,190
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

1653
01:52:58,690 --> 01:53:00,359
I am the Mandarin!

1654
01:53:11,787 --> 01:53:13,038
I got nothing.

1655
01:53:19,878 --> 01:53:22,631
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

1656
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:32,808
What? What, are you mad at me?

1657
01:53:58,917 --> 01:54:00,127
Honey?

1658
01:54:04,381 --> 01:54:06,049
Oh, my God.

1659
01:54:07,592 --> 01:54:09,803
That was really violent.

1660
01:54:10,804 --> 01:54:12,806
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

1661
01:54:12,973 --> 01:54:15,017
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

1662
01:54:18,478 --> 01:54:20,147
Who's the hot mess now?

1663
01:54:20,313 --> 01:54:22,399
It's still debatable.

1664
01:54:22,941 --> 01:54:26,361
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home?

1665
01:54:26,445 --> 01:54:28,363
Sport bra. The whole deal.

1666
01:54:28,447 --> 01:54:31,658
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

1667
01:54:31,825 --> 01:54:34,369
What am I going to complain
about now?

1668
01:54:35,203 --> 01:54:36,830
Well, it's me.

1669
01:54:37,622 --> 01:54:38,665
You'll think of something.

1670
01:54:40,250 --> 01:54:41,626
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

1671
01:54:41,710 --> 01:54:43,628
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

1672
01:54:44,671 --> 01:54:45,672
Not hot.

1673
01:54:47,090 --> 01:54:48,759
Am I gonna be okay?

1674
01:54:48,842 --> 01:54:49,843
No.

1675
01:54:49,968 --> 01:54:52,637
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

1676
01:54:52,929 --> 01:54:54,765
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

1677
01:54:55,015 --> 01:54:56,725
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

1678
01:54:56,808 --> 01:54:59,936
I think I can get you better.

1679
01:55:00,562 --> 01:55:03,065
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

1680
01:55:03,148 --> 01:55:05,442
And all your distractions?

1681
01:55:06,359 --> 01:55:08,070
I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

1682
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,697
Jarvis. Hey.

1683
01:55:10,781 --> 01:55:14,076
<i>All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</i>

1684
01:55:14,326 --> 01:55:16,286
You know what to do.

1685
01:55:16,369 --> 01:55:19,122
<i>The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</i>

1686
01:55:19,206 --> 01:55:22,375
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

1687
01:55:58,662 --> 01:55:59,955
Okay, so far? Do you like it?

1688
01:56:02,541 --> 01:56:03,542
It Will do.

1689
01:56:12,676 --> 01:56:18,140
<i>And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.</i>

1690
01:56:21,518 --> 01:56:23,520
<i>You start with something pure,</i>

1691
01:56:24,521 --> 01:56:28,775
<i>something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</i>

1692
01:56:29,901 --> 01:56:31,570
<i>The compromises.</i>

1693
01:56:38,118 --> 01:56:40,829
<i>We create our own demons.</i>

1694
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,253
Great to see you! Bloody hell!

1695
01:56:49,796 --> 01:56:53,508
<i>As promised, I got Pepper sorted out.
It took some tinkering.</i>

1696
01:56:53,592 --> 01:56:57,387
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</i>

1697
01:57:01,224 --> 01:57:04,561
<i>Of course, there are people who say
progress is dangerous,</i>

1698
01:57:04,644 --> 01:57:08,148
<i>but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</i>

1699
01:57:08,565 --> 01:57:11,610
<i>And now, neither will I.</i>

1700
01:57:12,402 --> 01:57:14,321
<i>Let me tell you,</i>

1701
01:57:14,404 --> 01:57:16,531
<i>that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</i>

1702
01:57:37,427 --> 01:57:39,387
It's okay. It's okay.

1703
01:57:39,471 --> 01:57:40,513
It's okay.

1704
01:57:40,597 --> 01:57:41,598
No, look.

1705
01:58:58,883 --> 01:59:02,929
<i>So, if I were to wrap this up,
tie it with a bow, or whatever...</i>

1706
01:59:03,013 --> 01:59:07,309
<i>I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</i>

1707
01:59:07,392 --> 01:59:09,477
<i>or a hobby.</i>

1708
01:59:09,561 --> 01:59:11,563
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

1709
01:59:12,772 --> 01:59:14,566
<i>And now,</i>

1710
01:59:15,525 --> 01:59:17,819
<i>I'm a changed man.</i>

1711
01:59:26,745 --> 01:59:30,415
<i>You can take away my house,
and all my tricks and toys.</i>

1712
01:59:31,416 --> 01:59:34,252
<i>One thing you can't take away...</i>

1713
01:59:36,796 --> 01:59:38,590
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1714
02:09:04,405 --> 02:09:06,741
<i>You know, and thank you by the way.
For listening.</i>

1715
02:09:06,824 --> 02:09:09,285
<i>Plus, something about getting it off
my chest,</i>

1716
02:09:09,368 --> 02:09:12,914
<i>and putting it out there in the
atmosphere instead of holding this in...</i>

1717
02:09:12,997 --> 02:09:15,708
<i>I mean, this is what gets people sick,
you know.</i>

1718
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:18,836
<i>Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</i>

1719
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,422
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

1720
02:09:21,505 --> 02:09:22,632
and my experiences with someone,

1721
02:09:22,715 --> 02:09:25,259
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

1722
02:09:25,343 --> 02:09:26,719
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

1723
02:09:26,802 --> 02:09:28,554
Everything comes full circle.

1724
02:09:28,638 --> 02:09:32,058
And the fact that you've been able to
help me process...

1725
02:09:34,602 --> 02:09:36,062
- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.

1726
02:09:36,145 --> 02:09:37,229
We were at...

1727
02:09:37,438 --> 02:09:38,648
Are you actively napping?

1728
02:09:38,773 --> 02:09:41,025
I was... I... I drifted.

1729
02:09:41,525 --> 02:09:42,693
Where did I lose you?

1730
02:09:44,695 --> 02:09:46,364
Elevator in Switzerland.

1731
02:09:47,990 --> 02:09:49,408
So, you heard none of it.

1732
02:09:49,742 --> 02:09:52,703
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

1733
02:09:53,329 --> 02:09:54,622
I'm not a therapist.

1734
02:09:54,789 --> 02:09:56,666
- It's not my training.
- So?

1735
02:09:56,791 --> 02:09:58,417
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?

1736
02:09:58,501 --> 02:09:59,752
Temperament.

1737
02:10:00,002 --> 02:10:01,545
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

1738
02:10:01,629 --> 02:10:03,005
God, my original wound.

1739
02:10:03,255 --> 02:10:05,424
- 1983, all right?
- Yes.

1740
02:10:05,508 --> 02:10:08,219
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny.
That was weird.
